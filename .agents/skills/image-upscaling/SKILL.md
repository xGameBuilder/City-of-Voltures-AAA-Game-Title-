curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Upscale this product image 4x with face enhancement and noise reduction. This is the first of a series of product photos I need processed."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/product-001.jpg"],
    "session_id": "batch-upscale-products",
    "mode": "max"
  }'

# Second image (same session maintains settings)
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Upscale this next product image using the same settings as before."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/product-002.jpg"],
    "session_id": "batch-upscale-products"
  }'

# Third image
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Continue with the same upscaling settings for this product image."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/product-003.jpg"],
    "session_id": "batch-upscale-products"
  }'
```

## Best Practices

### Choosing Scale Factor
- **2x**: Sufficient for most web and social media use cases
- **4x**: Standard for print quality (300 DPI equivalent)
- **8x+**: Only for large format where viewing distance is greater

### Quality Tips
- **Source Quality Matters**: Higher quality input produces better upscaled output
- **File Format**: Use PNG or high-quality JPEG (90%+) as input when possible
- **Face Enhancement**: Enable only for images with human faces
- **Noise Reduction**: Use aggressively for low-light or heavily compressed images

### Output Considerations
- **File Size**: Higher scale factors produce significantly larger files
- **Processing Time**: 8x and 16x upscaling takes longer - be patient
- **Viewing Distance**: Large format prints are viewed from distance; extreme detail isn't always necessary

## Prompt Tips for Image Upscaling

When requesting upscaling, include these details in your prompt:

1. **Scale Factor**: Specify 2x, 4x, 8x, or 16x
2. **Use Case**: Web, print, large format display
3. **Image Type**: Photo, AI art, product shot, portrait
4. **Special Requirements**: Face enhancement, noise reduction, artifact removal
5. **Output Intent**: Final use case helps optimize processing

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Upscale this [image type] [scale factor] for [use case].
[Special requirements like face enhancement or noise reduction].
[Additional context about the source image quality or intended output]."
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before processing:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final production images, print materials, important projects | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick previews, batch testing, web thumbnails | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Upscaling Workflow

Use `session_id` to iterate on upscaling results:

```bash
# Initial upscale
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Upscale this photo 4x for print"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/photo.jpg"],
    "session_id": "upscale-project-001"
  }'

# Request adjustments
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "The result looks good but can you also apply face enhancement and reduce noise?"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "upscale-project-001"
  }'

# Request different scale
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Actually I need 8x for a larger print. Can you upscale it further?"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "upscale-project-001"
  }'
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| Image too large | Source image exceeds maximum dimensions | Resize source image before upscaling |
| Timeout | Large scale factors take longer | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |
| Unsupported format | Invalid image format | Use JPEG, PNG, or WebP input |
