  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Apply a smooth gaussian blur to the background while keeping the person in focus. Moderate blur intensity - enough to hide details but keep sense of depth. Natural bokeh effect like a portrait mode camera."}],

## Multi-Turn Workflow Example

Use `session_id` to iterate on background replacements across multiple requests.

```bash
# Initial background removal
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Remove the background from this video of me presenting"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "bg-removal-project-001",
    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/presentation.mp4"]
  }'

# Iterate with different background
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Now replace it with a modern tech office background instead"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "bg-removal-project-001"
  }'

# Fine-tune the result
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "The edges look a bit rough around my hair. Can you refine the matte for better edge quality?"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "bg-removal-project-001"
  }'
```

## Mode Selection

Choose the appropriate mode based on your needs:

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final production videos, client deliverables | Slower | Highest quality, best edge detection |
| `eco` | Quick previews, concept testing, drafts | Faster | Good quality, suitable for review |

**Recommendation:** Use `eco` mode for testing backgrounds and `max` mode for final renders.

## Best Practices

### For Clean Extractions
- **Lighting**: Well-lit subjects extract better than low-light footage
- **Contrast**: Higher contrast between subject and background helps
- **Movement**: Slower movements produce cleaner mattes
- **Hair/Fine Details**: Request "refined edges" for subjects with complex hair

### For Natural Composites
- **Lighting Match**: Request backgrounds that match your footage lighting
- **Color Grading**: Ask for color matching between subject and background
- **Shadows**: Request natural shadow placement for grounded composites
- **Depth of Field**: Match background blur to your camera's depth of field

### For Professional Results
- Specify your use case (corporate, social media, broadcast)
- Mention output requirements (resolution, format)
- Request specific background styles that match your brand

## Prompt Tips

When requesting background removal/replacement, include:

1. **Source Description**: What's in your video (person, product, etc.)
2. **Background Goal**: Transparent, solid color, specific scene, blur
3. **Quality Requirements**: Edge quality, shadow handling, reflections
4. **Use Case**: Where will this video be used
5. **Style Matching**: Lighting, color tone, atmosphere

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Remove/replace the background from this [subject type] video.
[New background description or transparent/solid color].
[Edge quality and compositing requirements].
For use in [context/platform]."
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| Timeout | Video processing takes time | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |
| Poor edge quality | Complex hair/fine details | Request "refined edge detection" in prompt |
| Subject detection failed | Low contrast footage | Try with better lit footage or specify subject location |

## Timeout Configuration

Video background removal is computationally intensive. Configure your HTTP client with adequate timeout:

- **Minimum recommended timeout**: 10 minutes (600 seconds)
- **For longer videos**: Increase proportionally (1 minute timeout per 10 seconds of video)

```bash
# Example with explicit timeout using curl
curl --max-time 600 -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Remove background from this video"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "max",
    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/long-video.mp4"]
  }'
```
