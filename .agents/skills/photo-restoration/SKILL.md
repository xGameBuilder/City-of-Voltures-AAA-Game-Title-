    "stream": true,
    "mode": "eco",
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/family-photo-1.jpg"]
  }'

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before processing:

**"Do you want fast & affordable, or highest quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final restorations, precious family photos, professional archival work | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick previews, batch processing, initial assessments | Faster | Good |

## Best Practices

### For Optimal Results

- **Provide context**: Mention the era, type of damage, and what aspects are most important to preserve
- **Start with damage repair**: Fix scratches and tears before colorization
- **Use multi-turn sessions**: Build up restoration in stages for complex projects
- **Specify faces**: If faces are important, explicitly mention face restoration
- **Preserve authenticity**: Request preservation of vintage qualities if desired

### Prompt Tips

1. **Describe the damage**: Scratches, tears, fading, water stains, yellowing
2. **Mention the era**: This helps with appropriate colorization
3. **State priorities**: What matters most - faces, overall clarity, color accuracy
4. **Set expectations**: Natural look vs maximum enhancement

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Restore this [era] photo. The damage includes [list damage types].
Focus on [priority areas]. [Additional preferences like colorization,
authenticity preservation, etc.]"
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| Content policy violation | Prohibited content | Ensure photo complies with content policies |
| Timeout | Complex restoration | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |
| Low quality result | Insufficient input resolution | Use highest available scan/photo resolution |
