Ask your users before processing:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final highlight reels, client deliverables, trailer cuts | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick previews, meeting recaps, internal reviews | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Highlight Refinement

Use `session_id` to iterate on extracted highlights:

```bash
# Initial extraction
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Extract highlights from this gaming stream, focus on the best plays"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "highlight-project-001",
    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/stream.mp4"]
  }'

# Refine selection
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Remove the third clip and find more moments with team fights"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "highlight-project-001"
  }'

# Adjust timing
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Make each clip shorter, around 15-20 seconds, and add transitions between them"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "highlight-project-001"
  }'
```

## Platform-Optimized Clips

Generate highlights optimized for different platforms:

```bash
# YouTube Shorts / TikTok (vertical 9:16)
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Extract viral-worthy moments and format them as vertical 9:16 clips for TikTok/YouTube Shorts. Each clip should be 15-30 seconds with a strong hook in the first 2 seconds."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "max",
    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/content.mp4"]
  }'

# Twitter/X (square 1:1)
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create square 1:1 highlight clips optimized for Twitter. Under 2 minutes each, punchy and shareable."}],

```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| `Video too long` | Exceeds processing limits | Split into smaller segments |
| `Unsupported format` | Video codec not supported | Convert to MP4 H.264 |
| Timeout | Long video processing | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |

**Important:** Video highlight extraction can take significant time for long videos. Always set your HTTP client timeout to at least 10 minutes to avoid premature disconnection.

## Best Practices

### Input Video
- **Format**: MP4 with H.264 codec works best
- **Quality**: Higher resolution enables better moment detection
- **Length**: For videos over 2 hours, consider processing in segments

### Prompt Tips
- Specify the number of highlights you want
- Describe the types of moments to look for
- Mention desired clip length
- Indicate output format requirements (aspect ratio, duration)

### Output Optimization
- Use `max` mode for final deliverables
- Use `eco` mode for quick previews and iteration
- Leverage `session_id` for multi-turn refinement
