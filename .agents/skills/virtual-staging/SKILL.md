## Best Practices

### For Real Estate Listings
- **Neutral Appeal**: Use colors and styles that appeal to the broadest audience
- **Show Scale**: Include furniture that helps buyers understand room dimensions
- **Preserve Features**: Ensure architectural details (fireplaces, windows, moldings) remain visible
- **Consistency**: Maintain the same style throughout a property listing

### For Maximum Realism
- **Match Lighting**: Request furniture that matches the existing room lighting
- **Appropriate Scale**: Ensure furniture fits naturally in the space
- **Shadows & Reflections**: High-quality staging includes realistic shadows

### Pro Tips
- Always provide high-resolution source images
- Specify the style upfront to avoid iterations
- Use session_id to generate consistent styling across multiple rooms
- For vacant homes, stage the key selling rooms: living room, master bedroom, kitchen
