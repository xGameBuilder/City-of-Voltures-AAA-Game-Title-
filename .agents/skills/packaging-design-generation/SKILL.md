## Best Practices

### Design Elements
- **Brand Consistency**: Maintain logo placement, color palette, and typography across packaging
- **Hierarchy**: Establish clear visual hierarchy with brand name, product name, and key information
- **Whitespace**: Use negative space effectively for premium feel
- **Materials**: Consider how design translates to different materials (matte, gloss, kraft, metallic)

### Technical Considerations
- **Bleed Areas**: Account for printing bleed in design requests
- **Die-Cut Windows**: Specify if product should be visible through packaging
- **Structural Design**: Describe box/container shape and dimensions
- **Print Finishes**: Mention desired finishes (foil stamping, embossing, spot UV)

### Industry Standards
- **Food Packaging**: Include space for nutrition facts, ingredients, allergens
- **Cosmetics**: Plan for ingredients list, usage instructions, warnings
- **Beverages**: Account for bottle shape and label wrap-around
- **Supplements**: Include supplement facts panel and FDA disclaimer space

## Prompt Tips for Packaging Design

When creating packaging designs, include these details in your prompt:

1. **Product Type**: What is being packaged (food, cosmetic, tech, etc.)
2. **Brand Name**: The brand identity to feature
3. **Product Name**: Specific product or variant name
4. **Design Style**: Minimalist, luxurious, playful, vintage, modern, etc.
5. **Color Palette**: Specific colors or mood (earthy, vibrant, monochromatic)
6. **Materials**: Kraft paper, glass, matte cardboard, metallic accents
7. **View Angle**: Front view, 3/4 angle, flat lay, mockup style
8. **Special Elements**: Windows, foil stamping, embossing, ribbons

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Create a [style] packaging design for [product type].
[Material/container type] with [color palette] colors.
Brand: [name]. Product: [name].
[Special features like windows, finishes, or structural details].
[View angle and presentation style]."
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final packaging designs, client presentations, print-ready concepts | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick drafts, concept exploration, initial ideation | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Creative Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate on packaging designs:

```bash
# Initial design concept
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a protein powder packaging design, modern fitness aesthetic, bold typography"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "protein-packaging-001"
  }'

# Iterate based on feedback
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{

  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create 2 flavor variants: Chocolate and Vanilla, keeping the same design language"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "protein-packaging-001"
  }'
```

## Product Line Consistency

Generate cohesive packaging across product variants:

```bash
# First product in line
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \

  }'

# Second product (same session for consistency)
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Now create the toner packaging in the same design language. Same brand identity but different bottle shape."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "pure-botanics-line"
