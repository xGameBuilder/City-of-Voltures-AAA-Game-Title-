## Best Practices

### Design Elements
- **Typography**: Use 2-3 complementary fonts maximum - script for names, serif/sans-serif for details
- **Hierarchy**: Names largest, date and venue prominent, additional details smaller
- **White Space**: Leave breathing room - avoid cluttered designs
- **Color Palette**: Stick to 2-4 colors that complement each other
- **Consistency**: Match all pieces in your stationery suite

### Text Content
- **Names**: Full formal names for traditional, first names only for casual
- **Date Format**: Spell out for formal (Saturday, the fifteenth of June), numeric for modern (06.15.2025)
- **Time**: Written out for formal (at five o'clock in the evening), numeric for modern (5:00 PM)
- **Venue**: Full name and city, detailed address on separate card

### Cultural Considerations
- **Religious Symbols**: Include appropriately (cross, Star of David, Ganesha, etc.)
- **Language**: Bilingual invitations for multicultural weddings
- **Traditions**: Incorporate cultural motifs and color symbolism
- **Multi-Event**: Indian weddings often have multiple events (Mehendi, Sangeet, etc.)

## Prompt Tips for Wedding Invitations

When creating wedding invitation designs, include these details:

1. **Couple Names**: Full names as they should appear
2. **Date & Time**: Complete date, day of week, and time
3. **Venue**: Full venue name and location
4. **Style**: Classic, modern, rustic, bohemian, etc.
5. **Color Palette**: Specific colors or general mood
6. **Motifs**: Flowers, geometric, cultural symbols
7. **Format**: Size and orientation (5x7 portrait, etc.)
8. **Stationery Type**: Invitation, save the date, RSVP, program

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Create a [style] wedding [stationery type] for [names].
Date: [full date and time].
Venue: [venue name and location].
Design: [detailed description of colors, motifs, typography].
Format: [size and orientation]."
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final print-ready designs, professional quality | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick drafts, concept exploration, comparing styles | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Design Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate on designs or create matching suites:

```bash
# Initial invitation design
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a romantic garden wedding invitation for Emily and Robert, June wedding at Rose Garden Estate. Soft pink and green floral design."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "emily-robert-wedding"
  }'

# Request design revision
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I love it but can you make the flowers more prominent and add some gold accents to the text?"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "emily-robert-wedding"
  }'
