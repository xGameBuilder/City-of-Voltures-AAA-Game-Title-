## Best Practices

### Image Composition
- **Vertical Format**: Always use 2:3 or taller ratios for maximum feed visibility
- **Text Space**: Reserve top 20-30% for title overlays
- **Focal Point**: Place main subject in center or using rule of thirds
- **High Contrast**: Ensure images stand out in a busy feed
- **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile viewing (most Pinterest traffic)

### Content Strategy
- **Lifestyle Context**: Show products in use, not just isolated
- **Aspirational**: Create images people want to save and recreate
- **Seasonal Relevance**: Consider trending topics and seasons
- **Searchability**: Think about what users search for
- **Series Consistency**: Maintain visual style across related pins

### Technical Specifications
- **Resolution**: Minimum 1000px width for crisp display
- **File Format**: PNG or JPG, optimized for web
- **Safe Zones**: Keep critical content away from edges (Pinterest may crop)
- **Color**: Use vibrant, saturated colors that pop in feed

## Prompt Tips for Pinterest Pins

When creating Pinterest pin images, include these details in your prompt:

1. **Aspect Ratio**: Specify 2:3, 9:16, or 1:2.1 for optimal format
2. **Pin Type**: Mention if it's a product, recipe, tutorial, etc.
3. **Visual Style**: Aesthetic preference (minimal, bohemian, modern, rustic)
4. **Text Space**: Request areas for title/text overlays
5. **Mood**: Cozy, energetic, luxurious, calm, etc.
6. **Target Audience**: Who will save this pin?
7. **Photography Style**: Flat lay, lifestyle, portrait, product shot

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Create a [aspect ratio] Pinterest [pin type] for [topic/product].
Show [visual description] with [style/aesthetic].
[Mood/lighting description].
[Text space requirements].
[Any additional Pinterest-specific requirements]."
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final pins ready to publish, hero content | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick drafts, testing concepts, bulk creation | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Creative Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate on pin designs:

```bash
# Initial pin design
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a 2:3 Pinterest pin for a fitness brand, showing healthy meal prep"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "fitness-pin-project"
  }'

# Iterate based on feedback
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Add more colorful vegetables and make the lighting brighter and more energetic"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "fitness-pin-project"
  }'

# Request variation
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create 2 more variations with different angles and compositions"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "fitness-pin-project"
  }'
```

## Seasonal Pin Batch Generation

Generate themed pin sets for seasonal content:

```bash
# Spring collection pin 1
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a 2:3 spring Pinterest pin for a gardening blog - show colorful tulips in a garden, morning dew, fresh spring aesthetic"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "spring-collection",
    "mode": "eco"
  }'

# Spring collection pin 2
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create another spring pin for the same gardening blog - show someone planting seeds in a terracotta pot, hands in soil, same fresh spring aesthetic"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
