## Multi-Turn Creative Iteration

Use `session_id` to refine background removal results:

```bash
# Initial removal
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Remove the background from this portrait photo"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/portrait.jpg"],
    "session_id": "portrait-project-001"
  }'

# Refine the result
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "The hair edges look a bit rough. Can you refine them to be smoother and more natural?"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "portrait-project-001"
  }'

# Change background
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Now place this cutout on a beach sunset background"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "portrait-project-001"
  }'
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final production images, complex edges, hair details | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick previews, batch processing, simple objects | Faster | Good |

## Best Practices

### For Products
- **Lighting**: Original image should have even lighting for best results
- **Contrast**: High contrast between product and background helps accuracy
- **Shadows**: Request shadow preservation for natural-looking results
- **Resolution**: Higher resolution input yields better edge quality

### For Portraits
- **Hair**: Mention hair type in prompt for better edge detection
- **Clothing**: Describe clothing edges if they blend with background
- **Accessories**: Note glasses, jewelry, or items that need preservation

### For Complex Subjects
- **Transparency**: Mention glass, smoke, or translucent elements
- **Fine Details**: Specify fur, feathers, or intricate patterns
- **Multiple Subjects**: Describe what should be kept vs removed

## Prompt Tips

When requesting background removal, include:

1. **Subject Type**: Product, person, animal, object
2. **Edge Complexity**: Simple edges vs hair/fur/fine details
3. **Output Format**: Transparent PNG or replacement background
4. **Background Color**: Specific hex code if replacing with solid color
5. **Use Case**: E-commerce, social media, compositing, etc.

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Remove the background from this [subject type].
[Specific edge requirements like hair or fur details].
Output as [transparent PNG / white background / specific scene].
This is for [use case] - [any specific requirements]."
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| Poor edge quality | Low resolution input | Use higher resolution source image |
| Halos around edges | Complex background colors | Use `max` mode for better edge detection |
| Timeout | Large image or complex processing | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |
