## Best Practices

### Photo Quality Tips
- **Clear photos**: Use well-lit, in-focus photos of your pet
- **Face visible**: Ensure the pet's face is clearly visible and not obscured
- **Multiple angles**: For best results, provide photos from different angles
- **Natural expressions**: Candid shots often produce the best portraits

### Prompt Tips
- **Be specific about style**: Mention specific art styles, artists, or references
- **Describe the mood**: Include emotional tone (playful, regal, peaceful)
- **Specify colors**: Request specific color palettes or schemes
- **Background details**: Describe the setting or background you want

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Create a [style] portrait of my [pet type].
[Specific style details and references].
[Background/setting description].
[Mood and lighting].
[Any special elements or accessories]."
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & affordable, or maximum quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final portraits, gifts, prints | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick previews, style exploration | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Creative Iteration

Use `session_id` to refine and iterate on portraits:

```bash
# Initial portrait
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a renaissance portrait of my dog as a nobleman"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/my-dog.jpg"],
    "session_id": "dog-portrait-project"
  }'

# Refine the result
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Make the costume more elaborate with gold embroidery and add a sword"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "dog-portrait-project"
  }'
