## Best Practices

### Character Design
- **Silhouette**: Create distinctive shapes recognizable at small sizes
- **Color Palette**: Limit to 3-5 main colors for brand consistency
- **Readable Features**: Large expressive eyes, clear facial features
- **Signature Elements**: Include memorable accessories or traits

### Live2D Preparation
- **Clean Linework**: Crisp lines without sketchy edges
- **Flat Colors**: Minimize complex gradients for easier rigging
- **Separated Elements**: Hair, face, clothing clearly distinguishable
- **Front-Facing**: Standard neutral pose facing camera

### Expression Sheets
- **Consistency**: Same art style and proportions throughout
- **Range**: Include basic emotions plus character-specific expressions
- **Clear Differences**: Each expression should be instantly recognizable
- **Grid Layout**: Organized arrangement for easy reference

### Accessories & Props
- **Style Match**: Same art style as main character
- **Scale Reference**: Show items at appropriate size
- **Multiple Angles**: Different views if needed for animation
- **Transparent Background**: Easy to composite in streaming software

## Prompt Tips for VTuber Art

When creating VTuber designs, include these details in your prompt:

1. **Character Type**: Gender, species (human, kemonomimi, fantasy)
2. **Visual Features**: Hair, eyes, distinguishing traits
3. **Outfit Style**: Theme, specific clothing items, accessories
4. **Expression/Pose**: Mood, body language, camera angle
5. **Art Style**: Anime substyle, level of detail, coloring style
6. **Technical Specs**: Background, output format, intended use

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Create a [view type] VTuber [character type].
[Physical description: hair, eyes, features].
Wearing [outfit description].
[Expression and pose].
[Art style specifications].
[Background and technical requirements]."
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final avatar designs, commission-quality work | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick concepts, style exploration, drafts | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Character Development

Use `session_id` to iterate on character designs:

```bash
# Initial concept
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a VTuber avatar concept: cozy streamer girl with autumn theme"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "autumn-vtuber-project"
  }'

# Refine based on feedback
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I like the design! Add maple leaf hair accessories and make the sweater more oversized and cozy looking"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "autumn-vtuber-project"
  }'

# Create variations
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Now create an alternate outfit version - same character but in a Halloween costume"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "autumn-vtuber-project"
  }'
```

## Character Asset Pipeline

Generate a complete VTuber asset set:

```bash
# Step 1: Main Avatar
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create main VTuber avatar: space-themed girl with galaxy hair and astronaut-inspired outfit"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "space-vtuber-assets",
    "mode": "max"
  }'

# Step 2: Expression Sheet (same session for consistency)
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Now create an expression sheet for this character with 6 different emotions"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "space-vtuber-assets",
    "mode": "max"
  }'

# Step 3: Chibi Version
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a chibi version of this character for emotes, super cute style"}],
