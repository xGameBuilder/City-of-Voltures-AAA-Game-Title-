## Best Practices

### Style Transfer Tips
- **Be Specific**: Describe the exact style elements you want (brushstrokes, colors, technique)
- **Reference Artists**: Mention specific artists or artworks for more accurate results
- **Preserve Features**: For portraits, mention if you want to preserve facial features
- **Intensity Control**: Use terms like "subtle," "moderate," or "dramatic" to control effect strength

### Image Guidelines
- **High Resolution**: Start with high-quality source images for best results
- **Clear Subjects**: Well-lit photos with clear subjects transfer better
- **Composition Matters**: Simple compositions often yield cleaner stylized results

### Prompt Tips for Style Transfer

Include these details in your prompts:

1. **Style Name**: Specific artist or technique (Van Gogh, watercolor, anime)
2. **Key Elements**: Brushstrokes, colors, textures you want
3. **Mood**: Dramatic, soft, vibrant, muted
4. **Preservation**: What to keep from the original (face, composition)
5. **Intensity**: How strongly to apply the style

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Apply [style name] style to this [subject type].
[Describe key style elements: brushstrokes, colors, technique].
[Mood and atmosphere].
[What to preserve from original]."
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final artwork, prints, professional use | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick previews, style exploration, drafts | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Style Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate on style transfers:

```bash
# Initial style transfer
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Apply Van Gogh style to this portrait"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/portrait.jpg"],
    "session_id": "style-project-001"
  }'

# Refine the style
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Make the brushstrokes more pronounced and add more yellow tones like in Starry Night"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "style-project-001"
  }'

# Try a variation
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Now create a version with cooler blue tones instead"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "style-project-001"
  }'
```

## Batch Style Exploration

Generate multiple style variations for comparison:

```bash
# Van Gogh variation
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Apply Van Gogh style to this photo"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/photo.jpg"],
    "mode": "eco"
  }'

# Monet variation
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Apply Monet impressionist style to this photo"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/photo.jpg"],
    "mode": "eco"
  }'

# Anime variation
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
