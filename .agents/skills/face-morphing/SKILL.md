## Multi-Turn Creative Iteration

Use `session_id` to refine and iterate on face morphs:

```bash
# Initial morph
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Morph these two faces together with a 50/50 blend"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": [
      "https://example.com/face-a.jpg",
      "https://example.com/face-b.jpg"
    ],
    "session_id": "morph-project-001"
  }'

# Adjust the blend ratio
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Adjust the blend to be 70% first face and 30% second face"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "morph-project-001"
  }'

# Request specific feature adjustments
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Keep the eyes from the first face but use the jawline from the second face"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "morph-project-001"
  }'
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final morph outputs, detailed blends, animations | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick previews, testing different combinations | Faster | Good |

## Best Practices

### Input Image Quality
- **Resolution**: Use high-resolution face photos (at least 512x512)
- **Lighting**: Consistent lighting across input images produces better blends
- **Face Position**: Front-facing photos with similar angles work best
- **Background**: Clean backgrounds help isolate facial features

### Morph Quality Tips
- **Similar poses**: Input faces with similar head positions morph better
- **Clear features**: Avoid obscured faces (sunglasses, hands covering face)
- **Age consistency**: For family predictions, consider parent ages at time of photos
- **Multiple runs**: Try different prompts to find the best blend style

### Animation Considerations
- **Frame count**: More frames create smoother transitions
- **Duration**: 2-5 seconds is ideal for morph animations
- **Loop-friendly**: Request seamless loops for social media use

## Prompt Tips for Face Morphing

When creating face morphs, include these details in your prompt:

1. **Blend Ratio**: Specify the percentage blend (50/50, 70/30, etc.)
2. **Feature Focus**: Which features to take from which face
3. **Output Type**: Image or video animation
4. **Style**: Realistic, artistic, exaggerated, etc.
5. **Age Target**: For child predictions, specify desired age

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"[Action] these faces with [blend ratio].
Take [features] from the first face and [features] from the second.
Output as [image/video]. Make it look [style descriptor]."
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| `No face detected` | Input image has no clear face | Use a clearer face photo |
| `Face alignment failed` | Faces too different in angle | Use photos with similar head positions |
| Timeout | Complex generation | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |
