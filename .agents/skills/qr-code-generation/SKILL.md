## Quick Start

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a stylized QR code for https://mywebsite.com with a modern tech aesthetic"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

## QR Code Design Considerations

| Element | Best Practice | Impact on Scannability |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| Error Correction | High (30%) recommended for artistic QR | Allows more design freedom |
| Logo Size | Max 30% of QR area | Larger logos reduce reliability |
| Color Contrast | Dark modules on light background | Essential for scanning |
| Quiet Zone | Maintain white border | Required for reliable scanning |
| Module Style | Rounded, dots, or custom shapes | Minimal impact if consistent |

## Best Practices

### Design Guidelines
- **Contrast is Key**: Maintain strong contrast between modules and background
- **Test Scannability**: Always verify the generated QR code scans properly
- **Error Correction Level**: Higher levels allow more artistic freedom
- **Quiet Zone**: Preserve white space around the QR code
- **Module Clarity**: Keep modules distinct even with artistic styling

### Color Guidelines
- **Dark on Light**: Traditional contrast works best
- **Avoid Red/Green**: May cause issues for colorblind users
- **Consistent Styling**: Apply effects uniformly across all modules
- **Background Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast with placement surface

### Size Recommendations
| Use Case | Minimum Size | Recommended Size |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| Business Card | 2cm x 2cm | 2.5cm x 2.5cm |
| Table Tent | 3cm x 3cm | 4cm x 4cm |
| Poster | 5cm x 5cm | 8cm x 8cm |
| Billboard | 15cm x 15cm | 20cm x 20cm |

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final production QR codes, print materials, branded assets | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick previews, concept testing, multiple variations | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Creative Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate on QR code designs:

```bash
# Initial QR code design
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a stylized QR code for https://mybrand.com with a modern tech aesthetic"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "qr-design-project"
  }'

# Refine the design
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Make the corners more rounded and add a subtle glow effect around the QR code"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "qr-design-project"
  }'

# Request color variation
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a version with gold and black colors for our premium product line"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "qr-design-project"
  }'
```

## Batch Generation for Multiple URLs

Generate consistent QR codes for multiple destinations:

```bash
# Main website QR
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a branded QR code for https://company.com with blue gradient styling"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "eco",
    "session_id": "company-qr-set"
  }'

# Product page QR
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a matching QR code for https://company.com/products in the same style"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "eco",
    "session_id": "company-qr-set"
  }'

# Contact page QR
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a matching QR code for https://company.com/contact in the same style"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "eco",
    "session_id": "company-qr-set"
  }'
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| Content policy violation | Prohibited content in URL | Use appropriate URLs |
| Timeout | Complex generation | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |
| QR not scanning | Too artistic, low contrast | Request higher contrast, simpler design |
