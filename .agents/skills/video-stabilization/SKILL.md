```

### 8. Aggressive Stabilization (Lock Shot)

Maximum stabilization for tripod-like locked shot results.

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Apply aggressive stabilization to lock this shot completely. I want it to look like it was shot on a tripod. Remove all camera movement and shake. It is okay to crop more of the frame if needed for maximum stability."}],

    "stream": true,
    "mode": "max",
    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/interview-handheld.mp4"]
  }'
```

### 9. Subtle Stabilization (Keep Natural Movement)

Preserve natural camera movement while only reducing noticeable shake.

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Apply subtle stabilization to this documentary footage. I want to keep the natural handheld feel and intentional camera movements, but remove only the unwanted micro-shakes and jitter. Do not make it look too smooth or artificial."}],

    "stream": true,
    "mode": "max",
    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/documentary-handheld.mp4"]
  }'
```

### 10. Stabilize and Crop Optimization

Balance stabilization strength with minimal frame cropping.

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Stabilize this footage but optimize for minimal cropping. The framing is important and I cannot lose too much of the edges. Find the best balance between stabilization quality and preserving the original frame as much as possible."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "max",
    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/tight-framing-shaky.mp4"]
  }'
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before processing:

**"Do you want fast processing or maximum quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final deliverables, professional projects | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick previews, draft reviews, high volume | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Stabilization Workflow

Use `session_id` to iterate on stabilization settings:

```bash
# Initial stabilization
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Stabilize this shaky video footage"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "stabilize-project-001",
    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/shaky-video.mp4"]
  }'

# Request adjustment
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "The stabilization is too aggressive, it looks artificial. Can you apply a more subtle stabilization that keeps some natural movement?"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "stabilize-project-001"
  }'

# Further refinement
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Good, but now there is too much cropping. Can you reduce the crop while maintaining similar stabilization?"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "stabilize-project-001"
  }'
```

## Batch Processing Multiple Videos

Process multiple videos with consistent settings:

```bash
# Video 1
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Stabilize this video with medium strength stabilization"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "eco",
    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/clip1.mp4"]
  }'

# Video 2
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Stabilize this video with medium strength stabilization"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "eco",
    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/clip2.mp4"]
  }'

# Video 3
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Stabilize this video with medium strength stabilization"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "eco",
    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/clip3.mp4"]
  }'
```

## Best Practices

### Input Video Quality
- **Resolution**: Higher resolution footage gives better stabilization results
- **Frame Rate**: Higher frame rates (60fps+) provide smoother stabilization
- **Codec**: Use high-quality source files, avoid heavily compressed inputs

### Stabilization Settings
- **Start Subtle**: Begin with lighter stabilization and increase if needed
- **Consider Cropping**: More aggressive stabilization requires more cropping
- **Match Style**: Keep stabilization consistent across clips in the same project

### Common Scenarios

| Scenario | Recommended Approach |
|----------|---------------------|
| Interview/talking head | Aggressive/lock shot |
| Documentary/vlog | Subtle, natural feel |
| Sports/action | Medium, preserve motion |
| Drone/aerial | Medium to aggressive |
| Walking tour | Medium, reduce bounce |
| Low light | Subtle, avoid artifacts |

## Prompt Tips for Video Stabilization

When requesting stabilization, include these details:

1. **Source Type**: What camera/device captured the footage?
2. **Shake Cause**: Walking, vehicle, wind, handheld, etc.
3. **Desired Result**: Lock shot, natural feel, smooth but dynamic
4. **Cropping Tolerance**: Is the framing critical or flexible?
5. **Use Case**: Social media, professional, documentary, etc.

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Stabilize this [source type] footage.
The shake is caused by [cause].
I want [desired result] stabilization.
[Cropping preference].
This is for [use case]."
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| Video format not supported | Incompatible codec | Convert to MP4/H.264 |
| Timeout | Long video processing | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |
| Excessive cropping | Too much shake | Use subtle mode or accept more crop |
