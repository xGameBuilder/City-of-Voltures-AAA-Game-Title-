## Best Practices

### Video Quality
- **Source Quality**: Use high-quality source videos (1080p or higher recommended)
- **Clear Audio**: Ensure source audio is clear with minimal background noise
- **Single Speaker**: Best results with single-speaker content; multi-speaker requires more processing

### Dubbing Tips
- **Natural Pacing**: AI adjusts speech rate to match lip movements
- **Preserve Emotion**: Original emotional tone is maintained in translations
- **Background Audio**: Original music and sound effects are preserved

### Lip Sync Optimization
- **Face Visibility**: Ensure speaker's face is clearly visible
- **Consistent Lighting**: Well-lit faces produce better lip sync results
- **Front-Facing**: Best results with front-facing or slight angle shots

### Subtitle Best Practices
- **Reading Speed**: Subtitles are timed for comfortable reading
- **Line Breaks**: Proper segmentation for readability
- **Timing Sync**: Accurate sync with audio and scene changes

## Mode Selection

Choose the appropriate mode based on your needs:

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final production, client deliverables, broadcast | Slower | Highest quality lip sync and voice |
| `eco` | Drafts, internal review, quick previews | Faster | Good quality, faster turnaround |

**Recommendation**: Use `eco` mode for initial reviews and `max` mode for final deliverables.

## Multi-Turn Localization Workflow

Use `session_id` to iterate on localization projects:

```bash
# Initial localization request
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Dub this video into Spanish with lip sync"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "dubbing-project-xyz",
    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/source-video.mp4"]
  }'

# Request adjustments based on review
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "The voice sounds too formal. Can you make it more conversational and energetic?"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "dubbing-project-xyz"
  }'

# Add subtitles to the approved version
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Add Spanish subtitles to this dubbed version"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "dubbing-project-xyz"
  }'
```

## Batch Localization

Process multiple videos or languages efficiently:

```bash
# Use eco mode for batch processing drafts
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create Spanish dubbed versions of these 3 marketing videos with subtitles"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "eco",
    "video_urls": [
      "https://example.com/video1.mp4",
      "https://example.com/video2.mp4",
      "https://example.com/video3.mp4"
    ]
  }'
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| `Video too long` | Source video exceeds limits | Split into shorter segments |
| `Audio not detected` | No speech in video | Ensure video contains speech audio |
| `Face not detected` | No visible face for lip sync | Use videos with visible speakers |
| Timeout | Complex generation | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |

## Technical Notes

- **Client Timeout**: Set HTTP client timeout to minimum 10 minutes for video processing
- **Video Length**: Optimal length is under 10 minutes per segment for best results
- **Output Format**: Generated videos are MP4 with H.264 encoding
- **Subtitle Format**: SRT files are provided for subtitle outputs
