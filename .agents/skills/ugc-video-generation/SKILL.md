# UGC Video Generation

Generate authentic user-generated content (UGC) style videos using the each::sense API. Create testimonials, unboxing videos, product reviews, tutorials, and selfie-style content that feels natural and relatable.

## Overview

UGC videos are characterized by their authentic, casual feel - as if recorded by a real person on their phone. This skill enables you to generate:

- **Testimonial Videos**: Talking head style content with genuine-feeling endorsements
- **Unboxing Videos**: First impressions and product reveals
- **Product Reviews**: Honest-feeling assessments and demonstrations
- **Before/After Content**: Transformation reveals and comparisons
- **Tutorial Videos**: How-to and instructional content
- **Day-in-Life**: Lifestyle content featuring products naturally
- **Get Ready With Me (GRWM)**: Personal routine content
- **Reaction Videos**: Authentic responses and first impressions

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \

## Best Practices for Authentic UGC Feel

### Visual Authenticity
- Request "iPhone footage" or "phone camera quality" in prompts
- Include natural lighting variations (window light, bathroom lighting)
- Allow for slight camera shake or imperfect framing
- Show real environments with some clutter or personalization

### Performance Authenticity
- Ask for "genuine" or "authentic" reactions
- Include natural pauses, thinking moments, looking away
- Request conversational, not scripted-sounding delivery
- Allow for minor imperfections - they add credibility

### Setting Authenticity
- Use real-life locations: bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, offices
- Include background elements that feel lived-in
- Match lighting to location (ring light for beauty, natural for lifestyle)
- Show products in natural use contexts

## Prompt Tips

### For iPhone Footage Look
Include phrases like:
- "iPhone selfie camera angle"
- "Front-facing camera perspective"
- "Phone propped up on surface"
- "Handheld phone footage"
- "Vertical video format"

### For Natural Lighting
Specify:
- "Natural window light"
- "Morning bathroom lighting"
- "Soft afternoon light"
- "Ring light visible in background" (for beauty content)

### For Casual Settings
Describe:
- "Bedroom with unmade bed visible"
- "Bathroom counter with products scattered"
- "Living room couch, relaxed setting"
- "Kitchen counter, morning routine"

### For Authentic Delivery
Request:
- "Conversational tone, like talking to a friend"
- "Genuine reactions, not over-performed"
- "Natural pauses and thinking moments"
- "Casual speech with some filler words"

## Mode Selection

| Mode | Best For | Quality |
|------|----------|---------|
| `max` | Final content, campaign assets | Highest quality, longer processing |
| `eco` | Drafts, testing concepts, iterations | Faster, lower cost |

```bash
# High quality for final assets
"mode": "max"

# Quick draft for concept testing
"mode": "eco"
```

## Multi-Turn Iteration with Session ID

Use session_id to maintain context and create consistent content across a series.

### Initial Video

```bash
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a UGC testimonial. Young woman talks about discovering a new vitamin brand. Casual, in her kitchen, morning light. She explains why she decided to try it."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "ugc-campaign-001",
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

### Follow-Up Video (Same Presenter)

```bash
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a follow-up video with the same presenter. Now she has been using the vitamins for 2 weeks. Same kitchen setting but different outfit. She shares her experience so far - more energy, better sleep. Still casual and genuine."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "ugc-campaign-001",
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

### Series Conclusion

```bash
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Final video in the series with our presenter. One month update. She gives her honest final review, would she recommend it? Kitchen setting, but this time shes making her morning smoothie while talking. Natural integration of the product into her routine."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "ugc-campaign-001",
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid or missing API key | Verify `EACHLABS_API_KEY` is set correctly |
| 400 Bad Request | Malformed request body | Check JSON syntax and required parameters |
| 413 Payload Too Large | Image files too large | Compress images or use smaller files |
| 429 Rate Limited | Too many requests | Implement backoff, reduce request frequency |
| 500 Server Error | Processing failure | Retry with exponential backoff |

### Retry Example

```bash
# Simple retry with delay
for i in 1 2 3; do
  response=$(curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
    -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
    -d '{
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a quick UGC testimonial video, casual selfie style, 10 seconds."}],
      "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
      "mode": "eco"
    }')

  http_code="${response: -3}"
  if [ "$http_code" = "200" ]; then
    echo "Success"
    break
  fi

  echo "Attempt $i failed with code $http_code, retrying..."
  sleep $((i * 2))
done
```
