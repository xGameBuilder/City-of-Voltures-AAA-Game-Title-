## Best Practices

### Design Principles
- **Thumbnail Clarity**: Design must be recognizable at small sizes (300x300 thumbnails)
- **Text Placement**: Leave 10-15% margin for artist name and album title
- **Color Contrast**: Use high contrast to stand out in streaming platform grids
- **Genre Authenticity**: Match visual style to the music genre expectations
- **Consistency**: Maintain visual identity across single and album releases

### Technical Requirements
- **Resolution**: Always request 3000x3000 for maximum quality
- **Aspect Ratio**: Standard album covers must be 1:1 square
- **Safe Zones**: Keep critical elements away from edges (may be cropped on some platforms)
- **File Delivery**: Output URLs provide high-resolution PNG/JPG files

### Platform Considerations
- **Spotify**: Requires 1:1 square, recommends 3000x3000
- **Apple Music**: Requires 1:1 square, supports up to 4000x4000
- **YouTube Music**: Requires 1:1 square
- **Bandcamp**: Supports various ratios but 1:1 recommended
- **Spotify Canvas**: Requires 9:16 vertical video, 3-8 seconds, loops seamlessly

## Prompt Tips for Album Covers

When creating album artwork, include these details in your prompt:

1. **Genre**: Specify the music genre for appropriate visual style
2. **Album/Song Title**: Include the title for thematic inspiration
3. **Mood**: Dark, uplifting, nostalgic, energetic, melancholic, etc.
4. **Color Palette**: Specific colors or color scheme preferences
5. **Visual Elements**: Key imagery, symbols, or scenes
6. **Style Reference**: Mention similar artists or album art styles
7. **Text Space**: Request space for title and artist name placement

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Create a [size] [genre] album cover for [title].
[Visual description] with [mood/atmosphere].
[Color scheme]. [Style reference].
[Additional requirements like text space, effects, etc.]"
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final release artwork, commercial releases | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick concepts, draft exploration, A/B testing | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Creative Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate on album artwork:

```bash
# Initial concept
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a 3000x3000 album cover for an ambient electronic album. Minimal, atmospheric, space theme."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "album-project-001"
  }'

# Refine based on feedback
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Make it darker with more contrast. Add subtle star field in the background and a gradient from deep blue to black."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "album-project-001"
  }'

# Request variations
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create 2 more variations with different color schemes - one in purple tones and one in warm orange/red sunset colors."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "album-project-001"
  }'
```

## Cohesive Release Strategy

Generate matching artwork for album, singles, and promotional materials:

```bash
# Main album cover
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \

  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a 3000x3000 album cover for \"Fragments\" by an indie band. Shattered mirror aesthetic with warm golden light fragments. Artistic and abstract."}],

    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "fragments-album-campaign"
  }'

# Single artwork (same session for consistency)
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create single artwork for the lead single from the same album. Use the same visual language but focus on a single large fragment. Maintain the color palette."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "fragments-album-campaign"
  }'

# Spotify Canvas
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
