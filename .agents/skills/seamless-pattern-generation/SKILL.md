## Best Practices

### Creating Seamless Patterns
- **Specify tileable/seamless**: Always mention that the pattern should tile seamlessly
- **Define scale**: Indicate if you need small repeat, medium, or large-scale patterns
- **Color palette**: Be specific about colors for brand consistency
- **Use case context**: Mention the intended application (fabric, wallpaper, digital)

### Pattern Design Tips
- **Balance**: Ensure even distribution of elements across the pattern
- **Contrast**: Include enough contrast for visual interest
- **Direction**: Specify if pattern should be directional or non-directional
- **Density**: Indicate how dense or sparse you want the pattern elements

### Technical Considerations
- **Resolution**: Higher resolution for print applications
- **Color mode**: Mention if CMYK-friendly colors are needed for print
- **Repeat type**: Specify if you need half-drop, brick, or straight repeat

## Prompt Tips for Pattern Generation

When creating seamless patterns, include these details in your prompt:

1. **Pattern Type**: Floral, geometric, abstract, etc.
2. **Design Elements**: Specific motifs and shapes to include
3. **Color Palette**: Exact colors or color mood
4. **Style/Aesthetic**: Modern, vintage, minimalist, maximalist
5. **Scale**: Small, medium, or large repeat
6. **Use Case**: What the pattern will be used for
7. **Seamless Requirement**: Always mention tileable/seamless

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Create a seamless [pattern type] pattern featuring [design elements].
[Color palette] on a [background color] background.
[Style/aesthetic] style, suitable for [use case].
Must tile perfectly/seamlessly."
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final production patterns, client deliverables | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick drafts, concept exploration, rapid iteration | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Pattern Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate on pattern designs:

```bash
# Initial pattern
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a seamless botanical pattern with ferns and monstera leaves, green tones on white"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "pattern-project-001"
  }'

# Iterate based on feedback
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Make the leaves larger and add some small berries in coral color"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "pattern-project-001"
  }'

# Request color variation
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a variation with a dark navy background instead of white"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "pattern-project-001"
  }'
```

## Pattern Collection Generation

Generate coordinating patterns for a collection:

```bash
# Main pattern
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a seamless floral pattern with large roses in dusty pink and sage green, vintage style"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "collection-vintage-florals",
    "mode": "max"
  }'

# Coordinating geometric
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a coordinating seamless stripe pattern using the same dusty pink and sage green colors, simple elegant stripes"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "collection-vintage-florals",
    "mode": "max"
  }'

# Coordinating small-scale
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a small-scale seamless polka dot pattern in the same color palette for a blender pattern"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
