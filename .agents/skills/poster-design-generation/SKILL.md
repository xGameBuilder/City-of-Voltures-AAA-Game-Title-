## Best Practices

### Composition & Layout
- **Typography Space**: Always request space for titles, headlines, and text overlays
- **Safe Zones**: Leave margins for print bleeding and important content
- **Focal Point**: Define a clear visual hierarchy and center of attention
- **Balance**: Specify if you want symmetrical or asymmetrical composition

### Visual Style
- **Color Palette**: Mention specific colors or mood-based palettes (warm, cool, vibrant, muted)
- **Lighting**: Describe lighting direction, quality, and atmosphere
- **Style Reference**: Reference art movements, eras, or specific design styles
- **Texture**: Request specific textures (grain, noise, paper, digital clean)

### Format Guidelines
- **Aspect Ratio**: Always specify the desired ratio for your use case
- **Resolution**: Higher resolution for print, standard for digital
- **Orientation**: Vertical (portrait) is standard for most posters

## Prompt Tips for Poster Design

When creating poster designs, include these details in your prompt:

1. **Purpose**: What is the poster for? (movie, event, product, etc.)
2. **Format**: Specify aspect ratio (2:3, 11:17, 1:1, etc.)
3. **Style**: Art style or era (minimalist, vintage, modern, etc.)
4. **Subject**: Main visual elements and composition
5. **Color Palette**: Specific colors or mood-based palette
6. **Typography Space**: Where text will be placed
7. **Mood/Atmosphere**: Emotional tone of the design

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Create a [format/ratio] [type] poster for [purpose].
[Visual description of main subject and composition].
[Style and aesthetic references].
[Color palette and lighting].
Leave space at [position] for [text elements]."
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final poster designs, print-ready artwork | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick drafts, concept exploration, style testing | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Creative Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate on poster designs:

```bash
# Initial concept
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a movie poster for a horror film, dark forest setting with fog"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "horror-poster-001",
    "mode": "max"
  }'

# Refine the design
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Add a creepy abandoned house in the background, and make the color palette more red and black"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "horror-poster-001"
  }'

# Request variations
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create 2 more variations with different compositions - one more minimal, one more intense"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "horror-poster-001"
  }'
```

## Poster Series Generation

```bash
# Series poster 1
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \

# Series poster 2 (maintains consistency)
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \

    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "festival-series-2024"
