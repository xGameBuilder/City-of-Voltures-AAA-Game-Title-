## Best Practices

### Face Filter Design
- **Natural Integration**: Filters should blend seamlessly with facial features
- **Proper Tracking Points**: Design around standard face landmark positions (eyes, nose, mouth, forehead)
- **Lighting Consistency**: Match filter lighting with typical selfie lighting conditions
- **Scale Appropriateness**: Elements should be proportional to face size

### Platform Considerations
- **Instagram/TikTok**: Vertical 9:16 format, mobile-first design
- **Snapchat**: Consider lens studio capabilities and limitations
- **Video Calls**: Subtle effects that work at lower resolutions

### Performance Tips
- **Simplicity**: Fewer elements = better real-time performance
- **Transparency**: Use proper alpha channels for overlays
- **Animation**: Consider how static designs translate to animated filters

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final filter concepts, client presentations, portfolio work | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick drafts, concept exploration, brainstorming variations | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Creative Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate on filter designs:

```bash
# Initial filter concept
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a cat face AR filter with whiskers and cat ears"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "cat-filter-project"
  }'

# Iterate based on feedback
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Make the ears more realistic and fluffy, add a pink nose, and include subtle face contouring to make cheeks more cat-like"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "cat-filter-project"
  }'

# Request variation
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a variation with black cat features instead of tabby, and add glowing yellow eyes effect"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "cat-filter-project"
  }'
```

## Filter Collection Generation

Generate multiple related filters for a campaign:

```bash
# Filter 1 - Dog
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create an AR filter with golden retriever dog ears and nose, cute and playful"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "eco",
    "session_id": "animal-filter-pack"
  }'

# Filter 2 - Cat
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Now create a matching cat filter with the same style - tabby cat ears and whiskers"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "eco",
    "session_id": "animal-filter-pack"
  }'

# Filter 3 - Bunny
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Complete the pack with a bunny filter - long floppy ears and a pink bunny nose"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "eco",

| Content policy violation | Prohibited content | Adjust prompt to comply with platform guidelines |
| Timeout | Complex generation | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |

## Prompt Tips for AR Filters

When creating AR filter concepts, include these details in your prompt:

1. **Filter Type**: Specify the category (face filter, beauty, makeup, etc.)
2. **Elements**: List all overlay elements needed (ears, nose, accessories)
3. **Style**: Realistic, cartoonish, minimal, elaborate
4. **Positioning**: Where elements appear relative to facial features
5. **Effects**: Particles, glow, color grading, distortion
6. **Platform**: Target platform if specific requirements exist
7. **Mood**: Fun, glamorous, scary, festive, etc.

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Create a [filter type] AR filter showing [subject description].
Include [overlay elements] with [style/aesthetic].
Add [effects/particles] and [additional features].
[Platform/mood requirements]."
```
