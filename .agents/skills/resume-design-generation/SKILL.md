## Best Practices

### Design Principles
- **Hierarchy**: Use clear visual hierarchy with consistent heading sizes
- **White Space**: Don't overcrowd - breathing room improves readability
- **Color Scheme**: Stick to 2-3 colors maximum for professionalism
- **Typography**: Use maximum 2 font families (one for headings, one for body)
- **Alignment**: Maintain consistent alignment throughout the document

### Industry-Specific Tips
- **Corporate/Finance**: Conservative colors (navy, gray), formal layouts
- **Tech/Startup**: Modern designs, skill visualizations, GitHub-style elements
- **Creative/Design**: Bold layouts, unique elements, portfolio integration
- **Healthcare/Legal**: Traditional formats, professional colors, clean structure
- **Academia**: Comprehensive sections, formal structure, publication formatting

### Format Considerations
- **Single Page**: Best for early-career professionals (0-10 years)
- **Two Pages**: Appropriate for senior professionals (10+ years)
- **Multi-Page CV**: Standard for academic and research positions
- **A4/Letter**: Ensure design works for both paper sizes

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final resume designs, professional use | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick drafts, concept exploration, testing layouts | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Design Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate on resume designs:

```bash
# Initial design
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a modern two-column resume design with a blue sidebar"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "resume-design-project"
  }'

# Iterate based on feedback
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Change the sidebar color to dark green and add a circular photo placeholder at the top"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "resume-design-project"

  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create an alternative version with the same content but a single-column layout"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "resume-design-project"
  }'
```

## Style Variation Batch Generation

Generate multiple style variations for comparison:
