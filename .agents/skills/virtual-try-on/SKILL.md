# Virtual Try-On

    ],
    "mode": "max"

```

## Using image_urls

The `image_urls` parameter accepts an array of image URLs for virtual try-on:

| Position | Purpose | Requirements |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| First image | Person photo | Clear, well-lit photo of the person |
| Second image | Product/item photo | Clear product image on neutral background |
| Additional images | Multiple products | For combining multiple items in one try-on |

### Image Guidelines

- **Person Photo**: Front-facing, good lighting, relevant body parts visible
- **Product Photo**: High resolution, clear product details, minimal background clutter
- **Supported Formats**: JPEG, PNG, WebP
- **Recommended Resolution**: 1024x1024 or higher for best results

## Best Practices

### Photo Quality

1. **Person Photo Requirements**:
   - Use well-lit, high-resolution images
   - Ensure the relevant body part is clearly visible (face for glasses, full body for clothing)
   - Avoid heavy filters or extreme angles
   - Front-facing photos work best for most try-ons

2. **Product Photo Requirements**:
   - Use official product images when available
   - Ensure the item is clearly visible and not obscured
   - White or neutral backgrounds work best
   - Multiple angles can improve accuracy

### Prompt Tips

- **Be Specific**: Describe exactly how you want the item positioned
- **Mention Fit**: Ask for natural fit and proportions
- **Reference Colors**: Specify if color matching is important
- **Include Context**: Mention the occasion or style goal

**Good Prompts**:
- "Show me wearing this navy blazer with natural shoulder fit"
- "Apply this eyeshadow palette for an evening look"
- "Put these glasses on me, adjusting for my face shape"

**Less Effective Prompts**:
- "Try this on" (too vague)
- "Put clothes" (no specific item reference)

## Mode Selection

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `max` | Highest quality, detailed rendering | Final visualizations, important decisions |
| `eco` | Faster processing, good quality | Quick previews, browsing multiple options |

```bash
# High quality for final decision
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Show me in this wedding dress with maximum detail"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/me.jpg", "https://example.com/dress.jpg"],
    "mode": "max"
  }'

    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/me.jpg", "https://example.com/tshirt.jpg"],
    "mode": "eco"
  }'
```

## Multi-Turn Sessions

Use `session_id` to try multiple items in a continuous session, maintaining context from previous interactions.

### Starting a Session

```bash
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "This is my photo. I want to try on several outfits for a job interview."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/my-photo.jpg"],
    "session_id": "tryon-session-12345",
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

### Continuing the Session

```bash
# Try first outfit
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \

    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/navy-suit.jpg"],
    "session_id": "tryon-session-12345",
    "mode": "max"
  }'

# Try second outfit

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \

    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/charcoal-blazer.jpg", "https://example.com/khakis.jpg"],
    "session_id": "tryon-session-12345",

    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Low quality result | Poor input image quality | Use higher resolution, well-lit photos |
| Incorrect placement | Unclear body positioning | Use front-facing photos with visible target area |
| Color mismatch | Product image has color cast | Use product images with accurate color representation |
| Item not visible | Product obscured in image | Use clear product images on neutral backgrounds |

### Handling API Errors

```bash
# Check response status and handle errors
response=$(curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Show me in this jacket"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/me.jpg", "https://example.com/jacket.jpg"],
    "mode": "max"
  }')

http_code=$(echo "$response" | tail -n 1)
body=$(echo "$response" | head -n -1)

if [ "$http_code" -eq 200 ]; then
  echo "Success: $body"
elif [ "$http_code" -eq 401 ]; then
  echo "Error: Invalid API key"
elif [ "$http_code" -eq 400 ]; then
  echo "Error: Invalid request - check image URLs and parameters"
else
  echo "Error $http_code: $body"
fi
```
