## Best Practices

### Design Guidelines
- **Placement**: Consider standard print areas (front center, left chest, back)
- **Resolution**: Request high resolution for print quality (300 DPI equivalent)
- **Color Count**: Specify limited colors for screen printing cost efficiency
- **Contrast**: Ensure design works on intended shirt colors
- **Edges**: Clean, defined edges for easier separation

### Print Considerations
- **Bleed Area**: Leave margin around design edges
- **Underbase**: For dark shirts, mention if white underbase is needed
- **Halftones**: Specify if gradients should use halftone patterns
- **Registration**: Simple designs with fewer colors = easier registration

### File Output Tips
- Request transparent PNG for versatility
- Specify if you need vector-style output
- Mention target print size (e.g., "12 inches wide for standard front print")

## Mode Selection

**"Do you want fast drafts or production-quality designs?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final print-ready designs, client presentations | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick concepts, design exploration, mockup iterations | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Design Iteration

Use `session_id` to refine designs through conversation:

```bash
# Initial concept
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a vintage motorcycle t-shirt design with a classic chopper"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "moto-design-001"
  }'

# Refine the design
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Add flames coming from the exhaust and put \"Born to Ride\" text in a banner below"}],

    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "moto-design-001"
  }'

# Request color variation
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a version with only black and gold colors for a premium look"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "moto-design-001"
  }'
```

## Design Collections (Batch Generation)

Generate multiple designs for a collection:

```bash
# Design 1 - Mountain theme
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create an outdoor adventure t-shirt design with mountains and \"Explore More\" text. Earth tones, vintage camping aesthetic."}],

    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "outdoor-collection",
    "mode": "eco"
  }'

# Design 2 - Forest theme (same session for style consistency)
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a matching design for the collection with forest and pine trees theme. Same style as the mountain design. Text: \"Get Lost\""}],

    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "outdoor-collection",
    "mode": "eco"
  }'

# Design 3 - Campfire theme
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Third design in the collection - campfire scene with stars. Same vintage outdoor style. Text: \"Under the Stars\""}],

    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "outdoor-collection",
    "mode": "eco"
  }'
```

## Prompt Tips for T-Shirt Designs

Include these details for best results:

1. **Style**: Illustrative, minimalist, vintage, cartoon, realistic, etc.
2. **Subject**: What the main visual element is
3. **Colors**: Specific colors or color scheme
4. **Target Garment**: Black tee, white tee, or both
5. **Print Method**: Screen print, DTG, etc.
6. **Placement**: Front, back, left chest, all-over
7. **Text**: Any typography to include
8. **Mood**: Edgy, fun, professional, artistic, etc.

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Create a [style] t-shirt design featuring [subject].
