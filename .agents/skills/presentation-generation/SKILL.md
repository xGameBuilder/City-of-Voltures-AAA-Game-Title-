- **Consistent design**: Maintain visual consistency throughout

### Slide Design
- **Minimal text**: Aim for 6 words per bullet, 6 bullets max per slide
- **High contrast**: Ensure readability with proper color contrast
- **White space**: Give content room to breathe
- **Consistent fonts**: Use 2-3 fonts maximum
- **Quality images**: Use relevant, high-resolution visuals

### Presentation Types

- **Sales presentations**: Lead with value, support with proof
- **Training materials**: Progressive disclosure, include exercises
- **Conference talks**: Big ideas, memorable visuals, minimal text

## Prompt Tips for Presentations

When creating presentations, include these details in your prompt:

1. **Slide count**: Specify how many slides you need
2. **Structure**: List the sections/slides you want included
3. **Audience**: Who will view this presentation?
4. **Style**: Corporate, modern, playful, academic, etc.
5. **Colors**: Brand colors or preferred color scheme
6. **Data points**: Include specific numbers, metrics, or statistics
7. **Visuals**: Request charts, diagrams, or specific imagery

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Create a [number]-slide [type] presentation about [topic].
Include: [list of slides/sections].
Audience: [who will view it].
Style: [design preferences].
[Additional requirements like colors, data points, etc.]"
```

## Mode Selection

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final presentations, client-facing decks, important meetings | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick drafts, internal meetings, concept exploration | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Presentation Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate and refine your presentation:

```bash
# Initial presentation
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a 10-slide pitch deck for a sustainable fashion marketplace"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "pitch-deck-project"
  }'

# Add more slides
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Add 3 more slides: one for partnerships, one for sustainability metrics, and one for media coverage"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "pitch-deck-project"
  }'

# Refine specific slide
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \

  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Update the market size slide with more detailed TAM/SAM/SOM breakdown"}],
