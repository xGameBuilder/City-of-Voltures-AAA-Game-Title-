# Video Speed Adjustment

Adjust video playback speed using each::sense. This skill enables speed manipulation for creative effects including slow motion, time-lapse, hyperlapse, speed ramping, reverse playback, and frame interpolation for ultra-smooth slow-mo.

## Features

- **Slow Motion**: Reduce playback speed (0.25x to 0.75x) for dramatic effect
- **Speed Up**: Accelerate video (1.5x to 4x) for quick recaps
- **Time-Lapse**: Extreme speed increase (8x to 20x) for long processes
- **Hyperlapse**: Stabilized time-lapse with motion smoothing
- **Frame Interpolation**: AI-generated frames for smooth slow motion
- **Speed Ramp**: Variable speed within a single clip
- **Reverse Playback**: Play video backwards
- **High FPS Output**: 60fps or 120fps output for smooth playback

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Speed up this video to 2x playback speed"}],

## Multi-Turn Speed Adjustment Workflow

Use `session_id` to iterate on speed adjustments:

```bash
# Initial speed adjustment
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a slow motion version of this video at 0.5x speed"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "speed-project-001",
    "video_url": "https://example.com/action-scene.mp4"
  }'

# Request further adjustment
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "The slow motion looks good but I want it even slower - make it 0.25x with frame interpolation for smoothness"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "speed-project-001"
  }'

# Add additional effect
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Now add a speed ramp at the end - gradually speed up from 0.25x to 2x over the last 3 seconds"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "speed-project-001"
  }'
```

## Best Practices

### Slow Motion
- **Source Frame Rate**: Higher source FPS (60fps, 120fps) produces better slow motion
- **Frame Interpolation**: Use AI interpolation for smooth results from 30fps sources
- **Output FPS**: Request 60fps output for smooth playback on modern displays
- **Avoid Extreme Slow-Mo**: Going below 0.25x may produce artifacts

### Speed Up / Time-Lapse
- **Audio Handling**: Remove audio for extreme speed-ups (4x+) or use pitch correction
- **Motion Blur**: Add slight motion blur for smoother fast-forward appearance
- **Stabilization**: Apply stabilization for handheld footage before speed-up

### Speed Ramps
- **Smooth Transitions**: Request gradual speed changes over 0.5-2 seconds
- **Mark Key Moments**: Describe which parts should be slow vs fast
- **Audio Sync**: Consider how speed changes affect audio/music sync

### Quality Tips
- **Mode Selection**: Use `max` for final exports, `eco` for previews
- **Resolution**: Higher resolution sources produce better results
- **Compression**: Request high bitrate output for quality retention

## Mode Selection

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final exports, client deliverables, portfolio work | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick previews, testing speed values, drafts | Faster | Good |

## Prompt Tips for Speed Adjustment

When requesting speed adjustments, include these details:

1. **Speed Factor**: Specify exact multiplier (0.5x, 2x, 10x)
2. **Frame Interpolation**: Request if needed for smooth slow motion
3. **Output FPS**: Specify desired frame rate (30fps, 60fps, 120fps)
4. **Audio Handling**: Keep, remove, pitch correct, or reverse
5. **Transitions**: For speed ramps, describe how transitions should feel
6. **Quality Priority**: Mention if smoothness or detail is more important

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"[Speed effect] this video to [speed factor].
[Frame interpolation requirement].
Output at [fps] for [use case].
[Audio handling instruction].
[Additional quality requirements]."
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| Timeout | Long video processing | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |
| Choppy slow motion | No frame interpolation | Request AI frame interpolation |
| Audio pitch issues | Speed change without correction | Request pitch correction or remove audio |

## Technical Notes

- **Client Timeout**: Set HTTP client timeout to minimum 10 minutes for video processing
- **Video Length**: Longer videos take proportionally more time to process
- **Frame Interpolation**: Adds processing time but dramatically improves slow motion quality
- **Maximum Speed**: Practical range is 0.1x to 20x depending on source footage
