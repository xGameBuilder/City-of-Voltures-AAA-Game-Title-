  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \

    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://your-domain.com/empty-bedroom-photo.jpg"],
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

**Virtual Staging Tips:**
- Provide high-quality, well-lit photos of empty rooms
- Reference the existing architectural features you want preserved
- Specify furniture style that matches the property's character
- Request realistic proportions and natural-looking placement

## Best Practices for Real Estate Photography

### Composition and Perspective
- Use wide angle language ("wide angle view", "expansive shot") to capture full rooms
- Specify corner angles for interior shots to show depth
- Include ceiling and floor references to convey room height
- Mention "straight vertical lines" to avoid distortion

### Lighting Descriptions
- "Bright natural light streaming through windows"
- "Warm afternoon golden hour lighting"
- "HDR balanced exposure" for interiors with window views
- "Soft diffused daylight" for even, flattering illumination

### Staging and Styling
- Keep staging neutral and widely appealing
- Specify "decluttered" and "clean" for professional look
- Include lifestyle elements: fresh flowers, books, throw blankets
- Match staging style to property price point

### Technical Quality
- Request "professional real estate photography" in prompts
- Add "high resolution" or "detailed" for sharp results
- Mention "color corrected" for accurate representation
- Include "publication quality" for listing-ready images

## Prompt Tips

**Effective prompt elements for real estate visuals:**

| Element | Example Phrases |
|---------|-----------------|
| Wide Angle | "wide angle lens", "expansive view", "full room visible" |
| Bright & Airy | "natural light flooding in", "bright and welcoming", "light-filled space" |
| Feature Highlights | "showcasing the fireplace", "highlighting the chef's kitchen", "featuring the pool" |
| Professional Quality | "MLS-ready photo", "publication quality", "professional real estate photography" |
| Time of Day | "morning light", "golden hour", "twilight", "midday sun" |
| Architecture Style | "modern farmhouse", "contemporary", "traditional", "mid-century modern" |

## Mode Selection

Choose the appropriate mode based on your quality and speed requirements:

| Mode | Best For | Characteristics |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| `max` | Final listing photos, marketing materials, client presentations | Highest quality, maximum detail, best for publication |
| `eco` | Quick previews, concept exploration, draft iterations | Faster generation, suitable for review stages |

```bash
# High-quality listing photo
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Luxury master bedroom with king bed, tray ceiling, sitting area by bay window"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "max"
  }'

# Quick concept preview
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Modern kitchen concept with waterfall island"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "eco"
  }'
```

## Multi-Turn Sessions for Property Series

Use `session_id` to maintain consistency when generating multiple images for the same property listing:

```bash
# Generate exterior shot
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Modern craftsman style home exterior, gray siding with white trim, covered front porch, landscaped yard, sunny day"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "property-123-listing",
    "mode": "max"
  }'

# Generate matching interior - maintains style consistency
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Living room interior of this craftsman home, matching the exterior style, built-in bookshelves, hardwood floors, neutral palette"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "property-123-listing",
    "mode": "max"
  }'

# Generate kitchen with same style language
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Kitchen of this craftsman home, shaker cabinets, apron sink, butcher block island, consistent with the home style"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "property-123-listing",
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

**Benefits of session-based property series:**
- Consistent architectural style across all images
- Cohesive color palette and finishes
- Unified quality and lighting approach
- Professional listing package feel

## Error Handling

Handle API responses appropriately in your integration:

```bash
# Request with error handling
response=$(curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Modern house exterior photo"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "max"
  }')

http_code=$(echo "$response" | tail -n1)
body=$(echo "$response" | sed '$d')

if [ "$http_code" -eq 200 ]; then
  echo "Success: $body"
elif [ "$http_code" -eq 401 ]; then
  echo "Error: Invalid API key"
elif [ "$http_code" -eq 429 ]; then
  echo "Error: Rate limit exceeded, retry after delay"
else
  echo "Error $http_code: $body"
fi
```

**Common issues and solutions:**

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid or missing API key | Verify EACHLABS_API_KEY is set correctly |
| 429 Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded | Implement exponential backoff retry |
| 400 Bad Request | Malformed request body | Validate JSON structure and required fields |
| Timeout | Complex generation taking too long | Consider using `eco` mode for faster results |
