## Best Practices

### Design Guidelines
- **Line Weight**: Specify if you want bold, medium, or fine lines
- **Shading Style**: Dotwork, smooth gradient, stippling, or no shading
- **Color vs B&G**: Black and grey ages better; color needs touch-ups
- **Placement**: Always specify body placement for proper proportions
- **Size**: Mention approximate size (small/palm-sized, medium/hand-sized, large/back piece)

### Style-Specific Tips
- **Traditional**: Request "bold black outlines" and "limited palette"
- **Japanese**: Mention "background elements" like wind bars, waves, clouds
- **Minimalist**: Specify "single line" or "continuous line" if desired
- **Geometric**: Request "perfect symmetry" and "clean edges"
- **Watercolor**: Ask for "no outlines" and "color bleeds"
- **Realistic**: Specify "photorealistic" and mention lighting direction

### Prompt Tips for Tattoo Designs

When creating tattoo designs, include these details in your prompt:

1. **Style**: Clearly specify the tattoo style
2. **Subject**: What is the main element or imagery
3. **Composition**: How elements should be arranged
4. **Line Work**: Bold, fine, or mixed line weights
5. **Shading**: Type of shading technique desired
6. **Color**: Full color, limited palette, or black and grey
7. **Placement**: Body location for proper sizing/orientation
8. **Size**: Approximate size of the final tattoo

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Create a [style] tattoo design of [subject].
[Composition details] with [line work] lines.
[Shading style] shading, [color preference].
Suitable for [placement] placement, [size] size.
[Additional style elements or references]"
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast drafts or highest quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final designs, client presentations, detailed work | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick concepts, style exploration, rough drafts | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Design Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate on tattoo designs:

```bash
# Initial design
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a neo-traditional snake and dagger tattoo design"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "snake-dagger-design"
  }'

# Add elements
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Add roses around the dagger and make the snake more menacing with detailed scales"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "snake-dagger-design"
  }'

# Style adjustment
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Convert this to black and grey only, with heavy contrast"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "snake-dagger-design"
  }'
```

## Placement-Specific Designs

Generate designs optimized for specific body placements:

```bash
# Sleeve design (wrapping)
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a full sleeve tattoo design with Japanese waves and koi fish. Design should flow around the arm and connect seamlessly. Include filler elements for gaps."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "max"
  }'

# Small wrist design
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a tiny minimalist tattoo design of a paper airplane with a dotted flight path. Very small scale suitable for inner wrist. Fine lines that will hold up at small size."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

## Reference Image Input

Use reference images for inspiration or style matching:

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a tattoo design in a similar style to this reference but featuring a phoenix instead. Match the line weight and shading technique."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "max",
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/tattoo-reference.jpg"]
  }'
```
