## Multi-Turn Object Removal

Use `session_id` for iterative removal and refinement:

# First removal
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Remove the car parked on the left side of this street photo"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/street-scene.jpg"],
    "session_id": "cleanup-project-001"
  }'

# Second removal (same session)
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Now also remove the garbage bins near the building entrance"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "cleanup-project-001"
  }'

# Refinement (same session)
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "The area where the car was removed looks a bit blurry. Can you improve the texture to match the surrounding pavement better?"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "cleanup-project-001"
  }'
```

## Prompt Tips for Object Removal

When requesting object removal, include these details in your prompt:

1. **What to remove**: Be specific about the object(s) to remove
2. **Location**: Describe where the object is in the image (left, right, center, background)
3. **Fill guidance**: Describe what should replace the removed area
4. **Context preservation**: Mention if certain elements should be kept intact

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Remove [object description] from [location in image].
Fill the area with [expected background/content].
Keep [elements to preserve] intact."
```

### Good Prompt Examples

- "Remove the person in the blue jacket standing near the fountain on the left side"
- "Remove all text and watermarks from the image, restore the original background"
- "Remove the car and fill with matching grass and pathway"

### Prompts to Avoid

- "Clean up this photo" (too vague)
- "Remove stuff" (not specific)
- "Make it better" (unclear objective)

## Mode Selection

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final deliverables, complex removals, professional work | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick previews, simple removals, bulk processing | Faster | Good |

**Recommendation**: Use `max` mode for complex removals (people, large objects) and `eco` for simple cleanups (small blemishes, dust spots).

## Best Practices

### For Best Results

- **High-resolution source**: Use the highest quality source image available
- **Clear descriptions**: Be specific about what to remove and where it is
- **Simple backgrounds**: Objects in front of simple, repetitive backgrounds are easier to remove cleanly
- **Multiple passes**: For complex scenes, use multi-turn removal to address one element at a time

### Challenging Scenarios

- **Complex backgrounds**: Objects in front of detailed, unique backgrounds may require manual refinement
- **Large objects**: Removing very large objects (more than 30% of image) may produce less realistic results
- **Reflections**: Objects with reflections may need separate removal requests for the object and its reflection
- **Shadows**: Remember to request shadow removal if the object casts a visible shadow

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| Content policy violation | Prohibited content | Review content guidelines |
| Timeout | Complex generation | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |
| Poor removal quality | Vague prompt | Be more specific about location and fill content |

## Client Timeout Configuration

Object removal operations can take time, especially for complex scenes. Configure your HTTP client with a minimum **10 minute timeout** to avoid premature disconnections.

```bash
# Example with extended timeout
curl --max-time 600 -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Remove all people from this crowded plaza photo"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/crowded-plaza.jpg"],
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```
