## Best Practices

### Color Grading Tips
- **Reference Images**: Describe a specific film or visual reference for consistent results
- **Be Specific**: Mention shadow color, highlight warmth, contrast level, saturation
- **Skin Tones**: Always mention if preserving natural skin tones is important
- **Mood First**: Start with the emotion/mood you want, then technical details

### Technical Considerations
- **Source Quality**: Better source footage yields better grading results
- **Consistency**: Use `session_id` to grade multiple clips with the same look
- **Preview First**: Use `eco` mode for quick previews, `max` for final output

### Common Terminology
| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Lift | Adjusts shadow brightness |
| Gamma | Adjusts midtone brightness |
| Gain | Adjusts highlight brightness |
| Crush | Deepening blacks beyond pure black |
| Push | Adding color tint to a tonal range |
| Color Cast | Unwanted color tint across image |

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final deliverables, client work | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick previews, look exploration, drafts | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Creative Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate on color grades:

```bash
# Initial grade
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Apply a cinematic teal and orange grade to this video"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "color-grade-project-001",
    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/my-video.mp4"]
  }'

# Refine the grade
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "The teal is too strong in the shadows. Can you reduce it and add more warmth to the skin tones?"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "color-grade-project-001"
  }'

# Apply to additional clips
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Apply the same grade we developed to this new clip"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "color-grade-project-001",
    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/second-clip.mp4"]
  }'
```

## Batch Color Grading

Grade multiple clips with the same look:

```bash
# Grade first clip and establish look
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Apply a moody cinematic grade to this video - this will be my hero look for the project"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "music-video-grade",
    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/clip-01.mp4"]
  }'

# Apply same look to remaining clips
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Apply the same color grade to these additional clips for consistency"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "music-video-grade",
    "video_urls": [
      "https://example.com/clip-02.mp4",
      "https://example.com/clip-03.mp4",
      "https://example.com/clip-04.mp4"
    ]
  }'
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| Content policy violation | Prohibited content | Ensure video complies with content policies |
| Timeout | Complex video processing | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |
| Video too long | Exceeds processing limits | Split video into shorter segments |

## Prompt Tips for Color Grading

When requesting color grades, include these details:

1. **Reference**: Film, director, or visual style reference
2. **Mood**: The emotional tone (moody, bright, dramatic, soft)
3. **Shadow Treatment**: Color and depth (crushed, lifted, tinted)
4. **Highlight Treatment**: Warmth, rolloff, color
5. **Saturation**: Overall and selective color intensity
6. **Contrast**: High, low, or specific curve shape
7. **Skin Tones**: Natural, warm, or stylized

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Apply a [style] color grade to this video.
I want [shadow description] shadows and [highlight description] highlights.
The mood should be [mood/emotion].
Reference: [film or visual reference].
[Specific requirements like skin tones, saturation, etc.]"
```
