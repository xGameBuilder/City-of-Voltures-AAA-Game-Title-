## Best Practices

### Render Quality Tips

- **Lighting**: Specify time of day and weather conditions for appropriate shadows and mood
- **Materials**: Describe textures explicitly (polished concrete, brushed steel, matte wood)
- **Context**: Include surroundings (streets, vegetation, people) for realism
- **Scale Reference**: Add people, cars, or furniture to convey scale
- **Camera Angle**: Specify perspective (eye-level, low angle, bird's eye)

### Prompt Structure for Architecture

When creating architectural renders, include these elements:

1. **Building Type**: Residential, commercial, institutional, mixed-use
2. **Architectural Style**: Modern, contemporary, traditional, industrial
3. **Key Features**: Materials, facade elements, structural systems
4. **Environment**: Urban, suburban, rural, waterfront
5. **Time & Weather**: Golden hour, midday, dusk, night; sunny, overcast, dramatic
6. **View Angle**: Eye-level, aerial, worm's eye, three-quarter view
7. **Context Elements**: People, vehicles, landscaping, neighboring buildings

### Example Prompt Template

```
"Create a photorealistic [view type] render of a [building type].
Architecture: [style], [key features], [materials].
Environment: [setting], [landscaping].
Lighting: [time of day], [weather conditions].
Include: [context elements like people, cars, etc.]
Style: [professional architectural visualization / specific mood]."
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast drafts or final presentation quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final presentations, client deliverables, marketing materials | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick concept exploration, early design iterations, massing studies | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Design Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate on architectural renders:

```bash
# Initial concept render
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create an exterior render of a modern beach house with large glass walls and a wooden deck"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "beach-house-project",
    "mode": "eco"
  }'

# Design revision
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Add a rooftop terrace with a pergola and outdoor kitchen. Make the facade more tropical with natural stone accents."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "beach-house-project"
  }'

# Time of day variation
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a sunset version of this design with warm lighting and the interior lights starting to glow"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "beach-house-project",
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

## Presentation Set Generation

Generate a complete set of renders for a project:

```bash
# Hero exterior shot
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create the main exterior hero shot of our modern villa project - front facade, golden hour, dramatic angle"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "villa-presentation",
    "mode": "max"
  }'

# Interior living space
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Now create an interior render of the main living area - open plan, same modern style, afternoon light"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "villa-presentation",
    "mode": "max"
  }'

# Aerial site view
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate an aerial view showing the villa in its landscape context - pool, garden, and property boundaries"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
