# Product Photo Generation

Generate professional product photography with the each::sense API. Create e-commerce ready images, lifestyle shots, and studio-quality product visuals for any item.

## Overview

The each::sense API enables generation of high-quality product photography suitable for:

- **E-commerce product shots** - Clean, professional images for online stores
- **Lifestyle context images** - Products shown in real-world settings
- **White background photography** - Standard catalog and marketplace images
- **Studio lighting setups** - Professional lighting for premium product presentation
- **Marketing visuals** - Eye-catching images for ads and promotions

You can also provide your own product images via `image_urls` to place your actual products into professionally styled scenes.

## Quick Start

## Best Practices for Product Photography

### Lighting Guidelines

- **Soft box lighting** - Even illumination for e-commerce shots
- **Rim lighting** - Creates separation from background
- **Natural window light** - Warm, authentic lifestyle feel
- **Dramatic side lighting** - Adds depth and premium look
- **Diffused overhead** - Minimizes harsh shadows

### Composition Tips

- Center important products for e-commerce
- Use rule of thirds for lifestyle shots
- Leave negative space for text overlay
- Consider the platform aspect ratio requirements
- Include context elements that tell a story

### Background Selection

- Pure white (#FFFFFF) for marketplace requirements
- Gradient backgrounds for premium products
- Contextual environments for lifestyle appeal
- Complementary colors that enhance product
- Textured surfaces for artisanal products

## Prompt Tips

Effective prompts for product photography include:

**Lighting descriptors:**
- "soft box lighting", "natural window light", "dramatic side lighting"
- "rim light", "backlit", "diffused overhead lighting"
- "golden hour warmth", "cool studio lighting"

**Angle specifications:**
- "eye-level shot", "45-degree angle", "overhead flat lay"
- "low angle hero shot", "three-quarter view", "straight-on"

**Background details:**
- "pure white background", "gradient gray backdrop"
- "marble surface", "wooden table", "concrete texture"

**Style references:**
- "e-commerce style", "editorial quality", "magazine advertisement"
- "catalog photography", "Instagram aesthetic", "premium brand look"

**Props and context:**
- "minimalist props", "lifestyle elements", "seasonal decorations"
- "complementary accessories", "natural elements"

## Mode Selection

| Mode | Best For | Output Quality |
|------|----------|----------------|
| `max` | Hero shots, marketing materials, premium products | Highest quality, detailed rendering |
| `eco` | Quick iterations, bulk catalog photos, testing concepts | Fast generation, good quality |

Use `max` mode for final marketing assets and hero images. Use `eco` mode for rapid prototyping and generating multiple variations quickly.

## Multi-Turn Sessions for Product Series

Use `session_id` to maintain consistency across a product line or catalog series.

### Start a product series session

```bash
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate a product photo of a blue ceramic coffee mug on white background with soft natural lighting, minimalist style"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "product-catalog-2024",
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

### Continue with consistent style

```bash
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Now generate the matching red ceramic mug in the same style and lighting setup"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "product-catalog-2024",
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

### Add variations

```bash
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a lifestyle version showing both mugs on a breakfast table with croissants"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "product-catalog-2024",
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid or missing API key | Verify `X-API-Key` header is set correctly |
| 400 Bad Request | Malformed request body | Check JSON syntax and required fields |
| 429 Rate Limited | Too many requests | Implement exponential backoff |
| 500 Server Error | Service temporarily unavailable | Retry after a brief delay |

### Retry with exponential backoff

```bash
for i in 1 2 3; do
  response=$(curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
    -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
    -d '{
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Professional product photo of wireless earbuds on white background"}],
      "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
      "mode": "max"
    }')

  http_code="${response: -3}"
  if [ "$http_code" -eq 200 ]; then
    echo "${response%???}"
    break
  fi
  sleep $((2**i))
done
```
