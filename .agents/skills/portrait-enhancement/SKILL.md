## Prompt Tips for Portrait Enhancement

When requesting portrait enhancements, include these details:

1. **Specific Enhancement**: What exactly to enhance (skin, eyes, teeth, etc.)
2. **Intensity Level**: Subtle, moderate, or dramatic
3. **Natural Look**: Emphasize keeping results realistic
4. **Areas to Preserve**: Features that should remain unchanged
5. **Use Case**: Headshot, social media, print, etc.

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Apply [enhancement type] to this portrait.
[Specific instructions for the enhancement].
Keep [what to preserve].
The result should look [desired outcome] for [use case]."
```

## Best Practices

### Maintaining Realism
- Always specify "natural looking" or "realistic" in prompts
- Request preservation of skin texture when smoothing
- Avoid over-whitening teeth or over-brightening eyes
- Keep enhancements subtle for professional contexts

### Preserving Identity
- Don't request changes that alter facial structure
- Preserve natural beauty marks and distinctive features
- Keep skin tone consistent across the image
- Maintain natural proportions

### Technical Considerations
- Provide high-resolution source images for best results
- Images with good initial lighting enhance better
- Front-facing portraits work best for most enhancements
- JPG and PNG formats are supported
