## Best Practices for YouTube Thumbnails

### Design Principles

1. **Faces Drive Clicks**: Include expressive human faces whenever possible. Emotions like shock, joy, curiosity, and disbelief perform best.

2. **Exaggerate Emotions**: Subtle expressions get lost. Go bigger with facial expressions than feels natural.

3. **High Contrast**: Thumbnails appear small in feeds. Strong contrast ensures visibility at any size.

4. **Readable Text Space**: Leave clean areas for text overlay. Busy backgrounds make text illegible.

5. **Standard Dimensions**: Always use 1280x720 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio) for optimal display.

6. **Color Psychology**: Bright yellows, reds, and blues grab attention. Avoid muted or dark color schemes.

7. **Rule of Thirds**: Position key elements along thirds for balanced, professional composition.

8. **Consistent Branding**: Maintain recognizable style elements across your channel thumbnails.

## Prompt Tips

Craft effective prompts for maximum thumbnail impact:

```bash
# Include these elements in your prompts:

# 1. Expressive Faces
"shocked expression, wide eyes, open mouth, exaggerated emotion"

# 2. Bold Color Specifications
"bright neon colors, high saturation, vivid yellow and red, electric blue"

# 3. Clear Focal Point
"subject centered, attention directed to main element, clear visual hierarchy"

# 4. Text Space Planning
"space on the right for text overlay, clean area at top for title, uncluttered corner"

# 5. Lighting Direction
"dramatic side lighting, spotlight effect, high contrast shadows"

# 6. Aspect Ratio
"1280x720, YouTube thumbnail format, 16:9 aspect ratio"

# 7. Energy Level
"dynamic composition, diagonal lines, action and movement"
```

## Mode Selection

Choose the appropriate mode based on your needs:

### Max Mode (Recommended for Thumbnails)

Higher quality output ideal for final thumbnails.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate a professional YouTube thumbnail with maximum detail and quality, person with excited expression, vibrant colors, perfect for publishing"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

### Eco Mode

Faster generation for rapid iteration and concept testing.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Quick thumbnail concept: shocked face, yellow background, text space right side"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "eco"
  }'
```

## Multi-Turn Sessions for Channel Consistency

Use `session_id` to maintain consistent style across multiple thumbnails for your channel.

### Start a Thumbnail Session

```bash
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I am creating thumbnails for a tech review YouTube channel. The style should be: clean modern aesthetic, blue and white color scheme, product focus with reviewer face, professional lighting, consistent text placement on the right side. Generate the first thumbnail for a smartphone review."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "tech-channel-thumbnails-001",
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

### Continue with Consistent Style

```bash
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Now create a thumbnail for a laptop review using the same channel style"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "tech-channel-thumbnails-001",
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

### Build a Thumbnail Series

```bash
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create the third thumbnail in this series for a headphones review, maintaining brand consistency"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "tech-channel-thumbnails-001",
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

## A/B Testing Variations

Generate multiple thumbnail variations to test which performs best.

### Variation A: Emotion Focus

```bash
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "YouTube thumbnail variation A: extreme shocked face taking up most of the frame, minimal background, pure emotional impact, red and yellow, text space bottom, 1280x720"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "ab-test-video-123",
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

### Variation B: Context Focus

```bash
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "YouTube thumbnail variation B: same topic but showing more context and environment, smaller face with interesting background elements, blue and orange, text space top right, 1280x720"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "ab-test-video-123",
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

### Variation C: Minimalist Approach

```bash
curl -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "YouTube thumbnail variation C: clean minimalist design, single powerful visual element, bold solid color background, maximum contrast, text space centered, 1280x720"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "ab-test-video-123",
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

## Error Handling

Handle API responses appropriately in your applications.

```bash
# Check response status and handle errors
response=$(curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" -X POST "https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate a YouTube thumbnail with shocked expression, bright colors, 1280x720"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "max"
  }')

http_code=$(echo "$response" | tail -n1)
body=$(echo "$response" | sed '$d')

if [ "$http_code" -eq 200 ]; then
  echo "Thumbnail generated successfully"
  echo "$body"
elif [ "$http_code" -eq 401 ]; then
  echo "Error: Invalid API key"
elif [ "$http_code" -eq 429 ]; then
  echo "Error: Rate limit exceeded. Please wait before retrying."
else
  echo "Error: HTTP $http_code"
  echo "$body"
fi
```
