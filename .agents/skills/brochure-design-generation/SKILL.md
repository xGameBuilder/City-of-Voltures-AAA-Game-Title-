## Best Practices

### Layout & Design
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Guide the reader's eye with clear heading structure
- **White Space**: Avoid overcrowding - let content breathe
- **Fold Awareness**: Place key content considering how the brochure unfolds
- **Bleed Areas**: Include 3mm bleed for professional printing
- **Safe Zones**: Keep important text 5mm from fold lines

### Typography
- **Font Pairing**: Use maximum 2-3 font families
- **Readability**: Body text should be 9-12pt minimum
- **Headlines**: Make them bold and scannable
- **Contrast**: Ensure text is readable against backgrounds

### Imagery
- **High Resolution**: Use 300 DPI for print-ready output
- **Consistent Style**: Maintain visual cohesion across panels
- **Brand Colors**: Apply consistent color palette
- **Photo Quality**: Use professional or high-quality stock imagery

### Content Structure
- **Cover Appeal**: Front panel should create immediate interest
- **Logical Flow**: Information should progress naturally
- **Call-to-Action**: Include clear next steps
- **Contact Info**: Always include ways to reach you

## Prompt Tips for Brochure Design

When creating brochure designs, include these details in your prompt:

1. **Format**: Specify brochure type (tri-fold, bi-fold, etc.)
2. **Industry/Purpose**: What is the brochure for?
3. **Brand Identity**: Colors, style, company name
4. **Content Sections**: What information to include
5. **Imagery Style**: Photography style, illustrations, icons
6. **Target Audience**: Who will read this brochure?
7. **Print Specifications**: Size, orientation if specific

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Create a [brochure type] brochure for [company/purpose].
[Brand colors and style preferences].
Include sections for: [content areas].
Target audience: [demographic].

```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final print-ready designs, client presentations | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick drafts, concept exploration, layout testing | Faster | Good |

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| Content policy violation | Prohibited content | Adjust prompt to comply with content policies |
| Timeout | Complex generation | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |
