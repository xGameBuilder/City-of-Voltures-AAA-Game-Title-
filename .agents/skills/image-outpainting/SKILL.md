# Image Outpainting / Extension

Extend images beyond their original boundaries using each::sense. This skill uses AI to intelligently generate new content that seamlessly blends with the original image, enabling aspect ratio conversions, background expansion, and creative image extensions.

## Features

- **Horizontal Extension**: Expand images left and right for wider compositions
- **Vertical Extension**: Add content above and below for taller images
- **Aspect Ratio Conversion**: Transform portrait to landscape or vice versa
- **Background Expansion**: Add more context and environment to photos
- **Uncropping**: Recover or imagine content outside the original frame
- **Panoramic Creation**: Turn single images into wide panoramic views
- **Product Photo Enhancement**: Extend product shots for banners and ads
- **Artwork Extension**: Expand illustrations and digital art

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Extend this image horizontally to create a wider 16:9 composition, maintaining the same style and lighting"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/original-photo.jpg"],
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

## Common Outpainting Scenarios

| Use Case | Target Ratio | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Portrait to Landscape | 16:9 | Convert vertical photos for video/desktop |
| Square to Widescreen | 21:9 | Create cinematic compositions |
| Product Banner | 3:1 or 4:1 | Extend product shots for web banners |
| Social Media | 4:5 or 1:1 | Optimize for Instagram feed |
| Panoramic | 2:1 or 3:1 | Create wide scenic views |
| Full Bleed | Custom | Add margins for printing |

## Multi-Turn Outpainting Session

Use `session_id` to iterate on outpainting results:

```bash
# Initial extension request
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Extend this beach photo horizontally to create a wider 16:9 composition"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/beach.jpg"],
    "session_id": "outpaint-beach-001",
    "mode": "max"
  }'

# Request adjustments
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "The right side extension looks good, but can you add some palm trees on the left side to balance the composition?"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "outpaint-beach-001"
  }'

# Further refinement
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Now extend it vertically as well - add more dramatic sky with sunset clouds above"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "outpaint-beach-001"
  }'
```

## Prompt Tips for Outpainting

When requesting image extensions, include these details in your prompt:

1. **Direction**: Specify horizontal, vertical, or all directions
2. **Target Ratio**: Mention the desired aspect ratio (16:9, 21:9, 3:1, etc.)
3. **Content Guidance**: Describe what should appear in extended areas
4. **Style Matching**: Request consistent lighting, colors, and atmosphere
5. **Subject Position**: Specify where the original subject should be placed
6. **Use Case**: Mention if it's for a banner, social media, print, etc.

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Extend this [image type] [direction] to [target ratio/size].
[Describe what to add in extended areas].
Maintain [lighting/style/atmosphere] consistency.
Position the original [subject] in the [location]."
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final outputs, professional use, complex scenes | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick previews, testing compositions, iterations | Faster | Good |

## Best Practices

### For Best Results
- **High-quality source**: Start with a high-resolution original image
- **Clear edges**: Images with distinct edges outpaint more seamlessly
- **Consistent lighting**: Describe the lighting in your prompt for better matching
- **Reasonable extensions**: Extending 2-3x the original size works best
- **Iterate**: Use sessions to refine results progressively

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't extend too far in one step - do it gradually
- Avoid extending images with complex foreground elements at edges
- Don't expect perfect results with heavily stylized or abstract images
- Be specific about what should appear in extended areas

### Aspect Ratio Reference

| Name | Ratio | Common Use |
|------|-------|------------|
| Square | 1:1 | Instagram, thumbnails |
| Standard Photo | 4:3 | Traditional photography |
| Instagram Portrait | 4:5 | Instagram feed |
| HD Video | 16:9 | YouTube, presentations |
| Cinematic | 21:9 | Film, ultrawide monitors |
| Panoramic | 2:1, 3:1 | Scenic views, banners |
| Banner | 4:1, 5:1 | Website headers, ads |

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| Content policy violation | Prohibited content | Adjust prompt to comply with content policies |
| Timeout | Complex generation | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |
| Poor edge blending | Low quality source | Use higher resolution source image |
