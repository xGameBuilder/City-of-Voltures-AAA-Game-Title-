```

### 9. Consistent Character Series (Multi-Turn)

Use `session_id` to maintain character consistency across multiple generations:

```bash
# First image - establish character
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate a glamour portrait, woman with long auburn hair, green eyes, elegant features, wearing a silk robe, soft window lighting"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "session_id": "glamour-series-001",
    "mode": "max",
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "enable_safety_checker": false
  }'

# Second image - same character, different scene
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate the same woman from the previous image, now in an outdoor setting, sheer summer dress, golden hour beach scene"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "session_id": "glamour-series-001",
    "mode": "max",
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "enable_safety_checker": false
  }'

# Third image - same character, artistic pose
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate the same woman in an artistic nude pose, classical sculpture aesthetic, studio lighting"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "session_id": "glamour-series-001",
    "mode": "max",
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "enable_safety_checker": false
  }'
```

### 10. Reference-Based Generation

Use `image_urls` to provide style or pose references:

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate a glamour photograph matching the pose and lighting style from this reference image, but with a different model and setting"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/reference-pose.jpg"],
    "mode": "max",
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "enable_safety_checker": false
  }'
```

## Mode Selection

### MAX Mode (Recommended for NSFW)

Uses the highest quality models for detailed, refined output. Best for final content and publication-ready images.

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate artistic boudoir photography..."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "max",
    "enable_safety_checker": false
  }'
```

### ECO Mode

Faster and more cost-effective. Good for testing prompts and generating drafts.

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate artistic boudoir photography..."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "mode": "eco",
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "enable_safety_checker": false
  }'
```

## Best Practices

### Artistic Approach

1. **Use artistic terminology** - Reference fine art, photography styles, and classical aesthetics
2. **Describe lighting** - Chiaroscuro, golden hour, soft diffused, dramatic shadows
3. **Reference art movements** - Renaissance, Baroque, Art Nouveau, contemporary
4. **Emphasize composition** - Rule of thirds, leading lines, negative space

### Quality Prompts

1. **Be descriptive** - Include setting, mood, lighting, and artistic style
2. **Use quality modifiers** - "gallery quality," "high-end editorial," "museum-worthy"
3. **Specify camera details** - Depth of field, focal length, lens characteristics
4. **Define mood** - Romantic, dramatic, playful, mysterious, elegant

### Content Guidelines

1. **Artistic intent** - Frame requests as art or professional photography
2. **Consent themes** - All generated content depicts fictional, consenting adults
3. **Platform compliance** - Ensure generated content meets your platform's policies
4. **Commercial use** - Review EachLabs terms for commercial usage rights

### Prompt Tips

**Effective prompt structure:**
```
[Subject description] + [Setting/environment] + [Lighting] + [Style/aesthetic] + [Quality modifiers]
```

**Example:**
```
"Elegant woman with flowing dark hair + luxurious marble bathroom setting +
soft candlelight with warm reflections + Helmut Newton inspired glamour +
fashion magazine quality, 8K, detailed"
```
