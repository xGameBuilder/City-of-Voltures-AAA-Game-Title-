    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "subtitle-timing-project"
  }'
```

### 10. Batch Subtitle Generation

Generate subtitles for multiple videos in a single workflow.

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate English subtitles for all these videos. Output SRT files for each. Use consistent formatting across all videos: max 2 lines, 42 characters per line, minimum 1 second display time per subtitle."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "max",
    "file_urls": [
      "https://example.com/episode-01.mp4",
      "https://example.com/episode-02.mp4",
      "https://example.com/episode-03.mp4"
    ]
  }'
```

## Best Practices

### Transcription Quality
- **Clear Audio**: Best results with clear speech and minimal background noise
- **Language Hint**: Specify the source language for better accuracy
- **Speaker Count**: Mention number of speakers for better diarization
- **Context**: Provide context about the content (technical terms, names) for accuracy

### Subtitle Formatting
- **Line Length**: Keep lines under 42 characters for readability
- **Duration**: Each subtitle should display for 1-7 seconds
- **Lines Per Subtitle**: Maximum 2 lines per subtitle block
- **Reading Speed**: Target 150-180 words per minute for comfortable reading

### Animated Captions
- **Font Choice**: Bold, sans-serif fonts work best for short-form content
- **Contrast**: Use outlines or shadows for visibility on any background
- **Position**: Keep safe zones clear for platform UI elements
- **Animation**: Subtle animations are more readable than dramatic effects

### Translation
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Request localization, not just translation
- **Timing Flexibility**: Some languages need more time to read
- **Character Limits**: CJK languages often need fewer characters per line

## Prompt Tips for Subtitle Generation

When requesting subtitles, include these details in your prompt:

1. **Source Language**: What language is spoken in the video?
2. **Target Format**: SRT, VTT, burned-in, or animated?
3. **Style Requirements**: Font, color, position, animation
4. **Speaker Info**: Number of speakers, roles if known
5. **Special Terms**: Technical vocabulary, names, brands
6. **Output Languages**: Single language or multiple translations

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Generate [format] subtitles for this video.
Source language: [language].
[Number] speakers: [roles if known].
Style: [font, color, position requirements].
Special terms to recognize: [names, technical words].
Additional requirements: [line length, timing, etc.]"
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final subtitles, professional content, accuracy-critical | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick drafts, review copies, bulk processing | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Subtitle Refinement

Use `session_id` to iterate on subtitle generation:

```bash
# Initial subtitle generation
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate subtitles for this video with speaker identification"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "subtitle-project-001",
    "file_urls": ["https://example.com/interview.mp4"]
  }'

# Refine based on feedback
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Change Speaker 1 label to John and Speaker 2 to Sarah. Also fix the spelling of TensorFlow wherever it appears."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "subtitle-project-001"
  }'

# Add styling and export
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Now create a burned-in version with the corrected subtitles. Use yellow text for John and cyan for Sarah."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "subtitle-project-001"
  }'
```

## Language Support

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| Transcription quality low | Poor audio quality | Provide cleaner audio source |
| Language detection failed | Mixed languages or unclear speech | Specify source language explicitly |
| Timeout | Long video or complex processing | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |

## Client Configuration

**Important**: Subtitle generation can take significant time for long videos.

- **Minimum timeout**: 10 minutes (600 seconds)
- **Recommended**: Set timeout based on video length (2-3 minutes per minute of video)
- **Streaming**: Use SSE event handling to show progress
