## Best Practices

### Long-form Videos (16:9)
- **Hook viewers early**: First 5-10 seconds are critical for retention
- **Consistent pacing**: Maintain visual interest with scene changes every 5-10 seconds
- **Clear structure**: Use visual chapters and segment markers
- **End screens**: Design for YouTube's end screen overlay (last 20 seconds)
- **Thumbnails**: Create compelling 1280x720 thumbnails that stand out

### YouTube Shorts (9:16)
- **Vertical optimization**: Design for full-screen mobile viewing
- **Instant hook**: Capture attention in the first 1-2 seconds
- **Loop-friendly**: Create seamless loops when possible
- **Bold text**: Use large, readable captions for sound-off viewing
- **Keep it snappy**: Even though 3 minutes is allowed, 30-60 seconds often performs best

### Thumbnails
- **High contrast**: Use colors that pop against YouTube's white/dark UI
- **Readable text**: Limit to 3-5 words maximum
- **Faces work**: Expressive faces increase click-through rates
- **Consistent branding**: Maintain channel aesthetic across thumbnails

## Prompt Tips for YouTube Videos

When creating YouTube content, include these details in your prompt:

1. **Format**: Specify long-form (16:9) or Shorts (9:16)
2. **Resolution**: 1920x1080 for videos, 1280x720 for thumbnails
3. **Duration**: Be specific about video length
4. **Style**: Describe the visual aesthetic (cinematic, minimal, energetic, etc.)
5. **Content Type**: Faceless, tutorial, review, compilation, etc.
6. **Target Audience**: Who is this video for?
7. **Text/Captions**: Whether to include text overlays
8. **Music/Mood**: Describe the audio atmosphere

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Create a [duration] [format] YouTube [video type] about [topic].
Include [visual elements] with [style/aesthetic].
Target audience: [demographic].
[Additional requirements like text overlays, music style, transitions, etc.]
Resolution: [1920x1080 or 1080x1920]"
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final videos, published content, high production value | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick drafts, concept testing, storyboard visualization | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Creative Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate on video content:

```bash
# Initial video concept
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a 30-second YouTube Short about morning productivity tips"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "productivity-short-001"
  }'

# Iterate based on feedback
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Make the transitions faster and add more energetic text animations. Also add a stronger hook in the first 2 seconds."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "productivity-short-001"
  }'

# Create thumbnail for the video
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a thumbnail for this video at 1280x720. Make it eye-catching with bold text saying \"5 AM ROUTINE\" and show a sunrise with productivity imagery."}],

    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "productivity-short-001"
  }'
```

## Content Series Generation

Generate consistent content for a video series:

```bash
# Episode 1
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create episode 1 of a \"World Mysteries\" series - focus on the Bermuda Triangle. 2 minutes, dramatic documentary style, 16:9 at 1920x1080."}],

    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "world-mysteries-series",
    "mode": "max"
  }'

# Episode 2 (same session for style consistency)
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create episode 2 about Stonehenge. Keep the same visual style, intro, and format as episode 1."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "world-mysteries-series",
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```
