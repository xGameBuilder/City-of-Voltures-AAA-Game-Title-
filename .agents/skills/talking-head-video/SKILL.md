## Best Practices

### Script Writing
- **Keep it conversational**: Write scripts as natural speech, not formal text
- **Use contractions**: "We're" instead of "We are" for natural delivery
- **Break into segments**: For longer content, split into multiple shorter clips
- **Include pauses**: Use commas and periods to indicate natural pauses
- **Avoid jargon**: Unless your audience expects technical terminology

### Visual Quality
- **High-resolution source**: Use clear, well-lit portrait photos for lip-sync
- **Front-facing angle**: Best results with subjects looking at camera
- **Neutral expression**: Starting images work best with neutral or slight smile
- **Clean background**: Simpler backgrounds produce cleaner results

### Audio Considerations
- **Clear audio source**: Use high-quality audio for lip-sync features
- **Consistent volume**: Normalize audio levels before processing
- **Natural pace**: Speech that's too fast may affect lip-sync quality

### Brand Consistency
- **Use session_id**: Maintain consistency across multiple videos
- **Document appearance**: Keep notes on presenter descriptions for future use
- **Standardize backgrounds**: Use consistent settings for brand recognition

## Prompt Tips for Talking Head Videos

When creating talking head content, include these details in your prompt:

1. **Presenter Appearance**: Age, gender, attire, professional style
2. **Script**: The exact text to be spoken
3. **Tone/Delivery**: Professional, friendly, energetic, serious, etc.
4. **Background**: Office, studio, neutral, custom environment
5. **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9, 9:16, or 1:1 based on platform
6. **Emotional Expression**: Neutral, happy, serious, empathetic
7. **Language**: Specify language and accent if needed

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Create a talking head video with [presenter description].
Background: [setting/environment].
Script: [exact text to be spoken].
Delivery style: [tone and expression].
Format: [aspect ratio] for [platform/use case]."
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final production videos, client deliverables | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick drafts, script testing, concept review | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Video Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate on talking head videos:

```bash
# Initial video
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a talking head video with a professional presenter for a tech company intro"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "company-intro-video"
  }'

# Iterate based on feedback
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Make the presenter look younger and more approachable, change to casual business attire"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "company-intro-video"
  }'

# Update script
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Same presenter, but change the script to: Hey there! Welcome to InnovateTech. Were a team of passionate builders creating the future of AI. Ready to join us?"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "company-intro-video"
  }'
```

## Video Series Generation

Create consistent video series for courses or campaigns:

```bash
# Module 1

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
