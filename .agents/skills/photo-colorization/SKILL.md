  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \

  }'

# Second photo (same session for consistency)
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \

## Best Practices

### Image Quality
- **Resolution**: Higher resolution photos yield better colorization results
- **Contrast**: Good contrast in the original helps AI identify details
- **Clarity**: Sharp, clear photos colorize better than blurry ones
- **Condition**: Digital restoration before colorization can improve results

### Prompt Tips
- **Provide context**: Mention the era, location, or subject matter
- **Specify skin tones**: If known, describe the subject's complexion
- **Note clothing colors**: If you know original colors, include them
- **Describe the scene**: Outdoor/indoor, season, time of day

### Historical Accuracy
- Research the time period for authentic color palettes
- Consider regional variations in fashion and architecture
- Military uniforms and equipment have specific documented colors
- Vintage car and vehicle colors are often well-documented

## Mode Selection

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final restorations, archival work, gifts | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick previews, batch testing, drafts | Faster | Good |

**Recommendation**: Use `eco` mode for initial tests, then `max` for final output.

## Multi-Turn Refinement

Use `session_id` to iterate and refine colorization:

```bash
# Initial colorization
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Colorize this old portrait photograph with natural colors"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/portrait.jpg"],
    "session_id": "portrait-restoration"
  }'

# Refine the result
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "The skin tones look a bit too warm. Can you redo the colorization with cooler, more natural skin tones?"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "portrait-restoration"
  }'

# Further adjustment
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "The dress should be blue, not green. Please adjust the clothing color."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "portrait-restoration"
  }'
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| `Invalid image URL` | URL not accessible | Ensure image URL is publicly accessible |
| Timeout | Large image or complex scene | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |
| Poor colorization | Low quality source | Use higher resolution, clearer source image |
