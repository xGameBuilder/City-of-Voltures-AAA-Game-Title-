## Best Practices

### Design Guidelines
- **Clean Edges**: Ensure designs have clear boundaries for die-cutting
- **White/Transparent Background**: Makes production easier and cleaner
- **Bold Colors**: Use vibrant, saturated colors that print well
- **Simple Shapes**: Complex details may be lost at small sizes
- **Bleed Area**: Include extra margin for cutting tolerance

### Print Considerations
- **Resolution**: Request high-resolution output for print quality
- **Color Mode**: Consider CMYK-friendly colors for printing
- **Size Specification**: Mention target size in your prompt
- **Material Type**: Specify if designing for matte, glossy, or holographic materials

### Style Tips
- **Consistency**: Use session_id when creating sticker packs for visual consistency
- **Contrast**: Ensure good contrast for readability
- **Scalability**: Designs should look good at various sizes
- **Theme Cohesion**: Maintain consistent style across related stickers

## Prompt Tips for Sticker Designs

When creating sticker designs, include these details in your prompt:

1. **Sticker Type**: Die-cut, vinyl, holographic, etc.
2. **Subject/Theme**: What the sticker depicts
3. **Style**: Kawaii, minimalist, retro, hand-drawn, vector, etc.
4. **Colors**: Specific palette or color scheme
5. **Size/Format**: Target dimensions or aspect ratio
6. **Background**: White, transparent, colored, or gradient
7. **Special Effects**: Holographic, metallic, glow, etc.
8. **Use Case**: Where the sticker will be applied

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Create a [sticker type] sticker design of [subject].
Style: [artistic style].
Colors: [color palette].
Size: [dimensions/format].
Background: [background type].
Additional details: [special effects, text, decorative elements]."
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final print-ready designs, client deliverables | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick concepts, draft iterations, bulk exploration | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Creative Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate on sticker designs:

```bash
# Initial design concept
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a die-cut sticker of a happy cactus in a pot, kawaii style"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "cactus-sticker-project"
  }'

# Refine based on feedback
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Make the cactus blush more, add small flower on top, and include tiny sparkles around it"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "cactus-sticker-project"
  }'

# Create variations
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create 3 more variations with different expressions: sleepy, excited, and winking"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "cactus-sticker-project"
  }'
```

## Batch Generation for Sticker Packs

Generate multiple themed stickers efficiently:

```bash
# Sticker 1 - Main character
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a cute raccoon character sticker, sitting pose, holding a cookie, kawaii style with pastel colors"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "eco",
    "session_id": "raccoon-pack"
  }'

# Sticker 2 - Different pose
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Same raccoon character but sleeping curled up, with a tiny snot bubble"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "mode": "eco",
    "session_id": "raccoon-pack"
  }'

# Sticker 3 - Action pose
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Same raccoon character waving hello with sparkles, cheerful expression"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
