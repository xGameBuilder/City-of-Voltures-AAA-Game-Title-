## Multi-Turn Creative Iteration

Use `session_id` to iterate on your animations:

```bash
# Initial animation
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Animate this beach photo with waves and palm trees moving"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/beach.jpg"],
    "session_id": "beach-animation-001"
  }'

# Iterate based on feedback
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Make the waves more dramatic and add some birds flying in the sky"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "beach-animation-001"
  }'

# Request a variation
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a sunset version with golden hour lighting"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "beach-animation-001"
  }'
```

## Animation Tips

### For Natural Motion
- Request specific types of movement (breathing, hair, clothes)
- Specify the mood (calm, energetic, dramatic)
- Keep durations reasonable (3-10 seconds for most cases)

### For Cinemagraphs
- Identify the specific element that should move
- Request seamless looping
- Keep the moving area small and isolated

### For Ken Burns
- Specify start and end framing
- Indicate zoom direction (in/out) and pan direction
- Use longer durations for smoother movement

### For Product Shots
- Request orbiting or rotating camera movements
- Ask for lighting enhancements
- Specify the platform (e-commerce, social media, ads)

## Prompt Tips

When creating animations, include these details:

1. **Motion Type**: What kind of movement (subtle, dramatic, flowing)
2. **Duration**: How long the video should be (3-10 seconds typical)
3. **Looping**: Whether it should loop seamlessly
4. **Focus Area**: What elements should move vs. stay still
5. **Style**: Cinematic, professional, playful, etc.
6. **Purpose**: Social media, ads, website, presentation

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Animate this [image type] with [motion description].
[Specific elements to animate].
[Style/mood]. [Duration] seconds.
[Additional requirements like looping, aspect ratio]."
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| Image not accessible | Invalid or private URL | Use publicly accessible image URLs |
| Timeout | Complex animation | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |
| Content policy violation | Prohibited content | Adjust image or prompt to comply with policies |

## Client Timeout Requirements

Video generation can take several minutes depending on complexity and duration. Configure your HTTP client with:

- **Minimum timeout**: 10 minutes (600 seconds)
- **Recommended**: 15 minutes for longer videos
