## Multi-Turn Lighting Refinement

Use `session_id` to iteratively refine lighting across multiple requests:

```bash
# Initial relighting
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Add dramatic studio lighting to this portrait with strong shadows"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/portrait.jpg"],
    "session_id": "lighting-session-001"
  }'

# Refine the result
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "The shadows are too harsh. Can you soften them slightly while keeping the dramatic feel? Also add a subtle blue rim light on the shadow side."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "lighting-session-001"
  }'

# Try a variation
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create another version with warmer color temperature, like tungsten lighting"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "lighting-session-001"
  }'
```
