  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \

  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Add a dynamic watermark to this video that changes position every 5 seconds. The watermark should move between all four corners of the video. Use my logo with 30% opacity. This makes the watermark harder to remove."}],

    "stream": true,
    "mode": "max",
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/protected-content.mp4", "https://example.com/brand-logo.png"]
  }'
```

### 10. Batch Watermark Multiple Videos

Apply consistent watermarks across multiple videos in a session.

```bash
# First video in batch
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I need to add the same watermark to multiple videos. Start with this first video. Add my logo in the bottom right corner with 35% opacity. Remember these settings for the next videos."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "batch-watermark-001",
    "mode": "eco",
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/video-1.mp4", "https://example.com/company-logo.png"]
  }'

# Second video (same session for consistency)
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Apply the same watermark settings to this second video."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "batch-watermark-001",
    "mode": "eco",
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/video-2.mp4"]
  }'

# Third video (same session)
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Apply the same watermark settings to this third video."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "batch-watermark-001",
    "mode": "eco",
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/video-3.mp4"]
  }'
```

## Best Practices

### Adding Watermarks
- **Opacity**: Use 20-40% opacity for subtle branding, 50-70% for visible protection
- **Size**: Keep logo watermarks at 5-15% of video width for professional look
- **Position**: Bottom corners are standard; avoid center unless for drafts/previews
- **Contrast**: Add shadow or outline to watermarks for visibility on varied backgrounds
- **Consistency**: Use the same watermark settings across all your content

### Removing Watermarks
- **Quality**: Higher quality source videos yield better removal results
- **Simple backgrounds**: Watermarks over simple/uniform areas are easier to remove
- **Multiple watermarks**: Specify all watermark locations for comprehensive removal
- **Legal use**: Only remove watermarks from content you own or have licensed

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before generating:

**"Do you want fast & cheap, or high quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final output, professional content, watermark removal | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Batch processing, drafts, testing placement | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Watermark Iteration

Use `session_id` to refine watermark placement:

```bash
# Initial watermark
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Add my logo watermark to this video in the bottom right corner"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "watermark-project-001",
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com/my-video.mp4", "https://example.com/logo.png"]
  }'

# Adjust based on feedback
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "The watermark is too large and too opaque. Make it 50% smaller and reduce opacity to 25%"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "watermark-project-001"
  }'

# Final adjustment
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Move it slightly more to the center to avoid the video controls overlay area"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "watermark-project-001"
  }'
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| Content policy violation | Prohibited content | Ensure content complies with terms of service |
| Timeout | Long video processing | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |
| Invalid video format | Unsupported format | Convert to MP4, MOV, or WebM |
| Watermark not detected | AI cannot locate watermark | Specify watermark location more precisely |
