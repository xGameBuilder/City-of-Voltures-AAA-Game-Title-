## Quick Start

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{

    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "batch-denoise-project-001",
    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/project/clip-01.mp4"]
  }'

# Second clip (same session for consistency)
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \

    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/project/clip-03.mp4"]
  }'
```

## Best Practices

### Denoising Guidelines
- **Start Conservative**: Begin with lighter denoising and increase if needed
- **Preserve Motion**: Ensure temporal consistency to avoid flickering artifacts
- **Watch Skin Tones**: Aggressive denoising can create unnatural "plastic" skin
- **Maintain Texture**: Real textures (fabric, hair, foliage) should be preserved
- **Check Dark Areas**: Shadows often contain the most noise - focus there

### Input Considerations
- **Higher Resolution Source**: Better input quality yields better results
- **Uncompressed Preferred**: Work with least compressed source available
- **Color Space**: Maintain original color space when possible
- **Frame Rate**: Temporal denoising works better with higher frame rates

### Output Quality
- **Preview First**: Test on a short section before processing full video
- **Compare A/B**: Check before/after to ensure details are preserved
- **Export Settings**: Use high quality export to avoid reintroducing artifacts

## Prompt Tips for Video Denoising

When requesting video noise reduction, include these details:

1. **Noise Type**: Describe the kind of noise (grain, digital, compression, etc.)
2. **Source**: How was it captured (camera type, ISO, lighting conditions)
3. **Priority Areas**: What details must be preserved (faces, text, textures)
4. **Desired Look**: Natural vs. heavily processed, film vs. digital
5. **Problem Areas**: Specific issues to address (shadows, highlights, motion)

### Example Prompt Structure

```
"Denoise this [source type] video.
The noise is caused by [reason - low light/high ISO/compression].
Priority: preserve [important details like faces, text, textures].
Remove [specific noise types] while keeping [what to preserve].
[Any additional requirements]"
```

## Mode Selection

Ask your users before processing:

**"Do you want fast processing or maximum quality?"**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Quality |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| `max` | Final deliverables, client work, important footage | Slower | Highest |
| `eco` | Quick previews, test runs, bulk processing drafts | Faster | Good |

## Multi-Turn Iterative Denoising

Use `session_id` to refine denoising results:

```bash
# Initial denoise attempt
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Denoise this low light interview footage"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "interview-denoise-project",
    "video_urls": ["https://example.com/interview-raw.mp4"]
  }'

# Request adjustment
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "The skin looks too smooth and plastic. Can you redo it with more detail preservation? Keep some natural skin texture while still removing the noise."}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "interview-denoise-project"
  }'

# Fine-tune specific areas
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Better! But the background still has some noise. Can you apply stronger denoising to the out-of-focus background while keeping the subject sharp?"}],
    "model": "eachsense/beta",
    "stream": true,
    "session_id": "interview-denoise-project"
  }'
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to create prediction: HTTP 422` | Insufficient balance | Top up at eachlabs.ai |
| Timeout | Video processing takes time | Set client timeout to minimum 10 minutes |
| Unsupported format | Codec not supported | Convert to MP4 H.264 before processing |
| File too large | Video exceeds size limits | Split into shorter segments |
