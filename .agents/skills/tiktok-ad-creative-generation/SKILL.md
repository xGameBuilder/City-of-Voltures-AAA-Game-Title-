## Best Practices for TikTok Ads

### Hook in the First Second

TikTok users scroll fast. Your opening frame must grab attention immediately.

- Start with movement or action
- Use bold visuals or unexpected elements
- Avoid slow intros or logo reveals
- Lead with the most compelling moment

### Native Feel Over Polished Production

TikTok audiences respond better to authentic content than traditional ads.

- Use natural lighting when possible
- Embrace imperfection and rawness
- Mimic creator content, not TV commercials
- Keep the energy casual and relatable

### Sound-On Design

TikTok is a sound-on platform - design visuals that complement audio.

- Leave space for trending sounds
- Consider lip-sync moments
- Use visual cues that match beat drops
- Design for both sound-on and sound-off viewing

### Follow Trends (But Stay Relevant)

Leverage trending formats while maintaining brand relevance.

- Reference current TikTok trends in prompts
- Adapt viral formats to your product
- Keep content timely and fresh
- Avoid outdated or overused trends

### Mobile-First Composition

Design for vertical, full-screen mobile viewing.

- Keep important elements in the center
- Leave space for captions and UI elements
- Use close-ups for product details
- Ensure text is readable on small screens

## Prompt Tips for TikTok Aesthetic

### Include These Elements

- **Format**: Always specify "9:16 vertical" or "TikTok format"
- **Style**: UGC, authentic, native, creator-style, casual
- **Lighting**: Natural, ring light, golden hour, soft
- **Setting**: Bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, everyday spaces
- **Energy**: Fast-paced, punchy, dynamic, engaging
- **Camera angle**: Selfie, handheld, POV, overhead

### Effective Prompt Structure

```
[Content type] + [Subject/Action] + [Setting] + [Aesthetic] + [Format] + [Special elements]
```

Example:
```
"UGC-style TikTok ad + girl applying skincare + bathroom mirror + clean girl aesthetic + 9:16 vertical + morning light, text overlay space"
```
